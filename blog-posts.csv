"Maps, Hare And Hounds, Kings Heath, 25/10 ",,dandavies23,"<strong>“Cycling to MAPS with new bike lights”</strong>

Was the first Tweet I sent out as I cycled up to <a href=""www.hareandhoundskingsheath.co.uk"">Hare And Hounds, Kings Heath </a> last night. My father-in-law had come round in the daytime and fixed my bike whilst I locked myself away in the study trying to get my head around Pixel Pipe. The up-hill pedal to the venue was an absolute pleasure. Nothing rattled for a change and I had brand new lights – one  attached to my bike and another pinned to the strap of my camera bag – to guide my way. 

I may have lost some of my cool by accidently leaving the camera bag flashing light on as I wandered up to the bar. But my mobile LED disco may have added further ambiance to Tour Eifel’s superb set. The new solo project from the former (much missed) Grandscope member was aided by his own visuals, which according to another former Grandscope member Hydey, had taken a week and a half to pull together. 
 
<strong>“Gutted only caught last song by Tour Eifel, quality electronica with home made visuals”</strong>

Tour Eifel should have been second not first as the next act didn’t really compliment the shoegazing frug of Maps instead being a falsetto voiced navel-gazing guitar player. 

<strong> “Maps kick off with It Will Find You followed by Papercuts” </strong>

A strong start indeed, Mark Chapman has now employed ‘a Dane’ to add extra texture on tour. It sounds superb and the new material swims happily alongside the old. About 5 songs in Chapman speaks and it’s then that I realise that he’s pretty ratted.

<strong>“Maps (chap)man is smashed but septembers provide more than ample support”</strong> I Tweet. 

And the fact I didn’t spot that predictive text made that message partially incoherent indicates my state too. It’s a funny situation actually that it’s quite alright for someone like Ozzy Osbourne can spend the best part of his music career off his face but live electronic acts should always be sober and serious whilst they prod away at a laptop. I blame Kraftwerk. 

<strong>“At some point in the near future you're going to choose between another pint or an album from Merch. How depressing is that?”</strong>

I Tweet before I head to the Merch store and find out that the new album is a <em>tenner</em>.  It is signed though, and quality is worth paying for. Besides my freewheeling downhill cycle saves forking out on a taxi and is about 30 times more enjoyable.

Yesterday morning my wife's 3g iPhone arrived and it stirred mixed feelings in me. 

Like my strange mongrel approach to music, I don't side with either camp in a cod Mitchell-and-Webb-style. As a journalist who surfed the 'desktop publishing revolution' I've worked with both. And both have annoyed me.

My wife bought a G4 laptop last year, it was a nice bit of kit but its expense made me (and the wife) worry about taking it out and about, so I went for a Dell netbook. I was late getting an iPod, choosing instead to get more phone memory and put everything on my Sony Ericsson. 

It was only when we were flying back from San Francisco after ""The Drive Of Your Life"" that I succumbed and got two - from a <a href=""http://www.appleinsider.com/news.php?id=1060"">vending machine</a> in the airport!

So, two weeks ago Vodafone offered me a HTC Tattoo, a nifty little Android which I'm really enjoying. This is my first blog from it.

On Thursday Jules drops the iPhone bomb. I can't deny it is a thing of 'ubiquitous' beauty and plenty of people have pored over this fact. 

However, my Android has plenty of advantages - not least its easy integration with all things Google. It fits really nicely in my hand and feels sturdier. I won't worry about damaging it.

So Jules suffixed her iPhone delight with ""you can buy an iPad if you like"".

Maybe.

Maybe I'll hold out for the <a href=""http://dandavies23.tumblr.com/post/296748469/the-mag-video"">Mag+</a> which looks much more durable and hopefully a touch cheaper.","Android, apple, ipad, iPhone, ipod, technology, Uncategorized, Windows",

A few things occurred to me:

	<li>After denying that she was ever in the house we were able to get her to admit to disturbing us at least seven times.</li>
	<li>After claiming the noise wasn't her, she admitted it probably was</li>
	<li> She also admitted that making a noise, particularly in the week was a pain, and acknowledged we were upset.</li>
	<li>She claims to be ""young and that's what young people are like"" but listens to The Levellers</li>
</ul>
We asked her to keep the noise down between 11 and 7am. If she does it at the weekend we will ""buzz"" her flat if it's disturbing us. We will take this further if the situation continues. Probably the way of Orange_Monkey, not Drake Scorpio (yet)

Thanks for all of your suggestions, violent and non-violent alike. If there's any psychologists reading this who can analyse how successful this argument was then I'd love to hear what you thought!

Re:Cycling Experiment,,dandavies23,"<em>If you’re were a Hashbrum subscriber, or are a regular reader of this blog you may have noticed a recent obsession with cycling. The reason for this is it formed part of my MA Online Journalism course. I've split my assignment into three parts.
</em>

<strong>Part 1 – Pedalling The Raw Data</strong>

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/245.jpg""><img src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/245-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""Fort Dunlop &#039;P&#039;"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-291"" /></a>

This feature began with a simple observation, I'd started hearing and reading more news stories where cyclists had been involved in accidents. This interested me because I had been cycling into work. Working at Metro Newspapers at Fort Dunlop, I considered pitching a story to Birmingham Post about commuter cycling so I filed a Freedom Of Information (FOI) request on road deaths involving cyclists in the West Midlands.

When I started this course I began to think about different ways in which story could be told. My FOI request came through and I decided to map the deaths. I felt mapping could graphically represent the accidents which would help cyclists think about how they ride in that area. However, my FOI request had a significant flaw, the accidents were not located. 

I put the FOI on the HashBrum site alongside the map and set about trying to find the accident locations via news stories and police reports. I also launched an investigation on <a href=”http://bit.ly/5agnST"">Help Me Investigate</a>. 

“The first step in community organizing is to listen… you show that you are willing to not only listen to other voices in your online community, but to amplify them. That takes you into the second step in community organizing, building relationships.”(<a href=”http://www.ojr.org/ojr/people/robert/201001/1810/"">Niles</a>)

I responded to each comment and I hope I succeeded in what Axel Bruns would call “dialogic, coversational, unfinished news” (2005, 53.) People showed me other experiments that were taking place, other data that was available and successful national mash-up maps. 

I was encouraged by the different experiments taking place but they all stopped short of what I wanted for HashBrum. Dave Harte showed me a mash-up created by <a href=”http://bit.ly/4TSmaq”>Times Online</a> made from data which had been passed to me the day before. In December, I was shown a UK Crash Map on the <a href=”http://bit.ly/75JRkD”>BBC site</a>. They were expansive but I wanted something more local and with more detail.  

I was told about a similar investigation that was taking place in <a href=”http://bit.ly/7KFfmt”>New York</a> but no results had been mapped. Hannah Waldram was inspired by my experiment and launched a similar Help Me Investigate for Cardiff which I duly joined. 

“Digital age journalism is now also interactive. Until recently it was a one-way process... this is no longer the case. Discussion and debate over all kinds of issues is enhanced by the digital age.” (Herbert 2000, 2) 

I also received attention from the cycling community in Birmingham, including CTC and <a href=”http://birminghamcyclist.ning.com/”>Birmingham Cyclist Blog</a> and they both started following me on Twitter. One person who runs the Birmingham bike forum also contacted me in the New Year when a cyclist was involved in a serious collision in Solihull; I worked this fact into my story.

However, I was frustrated that I, or anyone else for that matter, couldn't find the older news stories to corroborate the FOI stats I had. I spotted another US site called <a href=”http://www.bikewise.org/”>Bikewise</a> they seemed to have access to full police reports.

I went hunting for other data. I discovered a site called SMIDSY (Sorry Mate I Didn't See You) a campaign launched by the Cycle Touring Club (CTC) which encouraged cyclists to report near misses and even get legal advice. I asked the administrator if I could access their data, they refused but were encouraging about the investigation. They offered some tips such as 'the cycling community prefers using the terms crash or collision rather than accident.' 

I decided the only data I could use was the UK government statistics. I decided I could marry the Birmingham pinpoints up with some of the missing FOI accidents. Following our mapping lesson I looked into ways put these stats on a map and then limit it to the Birmingham area. 

I launched another task using Help Me Investigate and spent many hours converting the stats to Longitude and Latitude and trying different sites that could accept a large amount of data. I tried Mapalist, Many Eyes, Google Earth Pro but I couldn't convert them. I contacted @Psychemedia a mash-up specialist but couldn't get it to work. When I disappeared into the world of Python I had to give up.

,,dandavies23,"For my MA Online Journalism I'm doing Production Labs placement with Village Underground, London. Following the last group <a href=""http://productionlab.posterous.com/minutes-from-village-underground-skype-meetin"">Skype meeting, () I thought it would be useful to do a case study on a venue that already has its online presence sorted. I managed to arrange a face to face meeting with Maryam Ashgari, a 28 minute edit of the meeting can be listened to below. 

[play]

But if you don't have half an hour to spare here are my conclusions. 

Website
The () Barbican website in its current state has been running for 9 months so it is a relatively new introduction. Maryam is still monitoring the success of her online experiments - the social media process and content production is still evolving. The website now highlights and flags up things that come up under the broad Barbican umbrella and it is also Maryam's job (in conjunction with an intern) to maintain other social media and keep a unified presence -  albeit not too rigid or dictatorial in tone or structure.

(conclusions: Village Underground is not nearly as big but a unified presence still needs to be maintained across all third party sites. I also discussed tone on these different sites, Maryam said (around 16 minutes) there is not really a discernable difference in register or style anymore. However, the main website draws from press releases so little bit of difference in content. The Barbican's tone across other social media is fairly rough and ready. In Village Underground's case I don't think there needs to be a register change.)

Facebook
Myspace is no longer really used by The Barbican and now () their Facebook site is the centre of their social media hub. Maryam talked about the importance of reacting to the community and answering any questions they had. If you don't react you lose the audience. She also mentioned posing questions or running small competition helped people interact with the site and gave them a reason for visiting. She also talked about the importance of not bombarding the audience via the Facebook mailing list. 

(conclusions: Although Village underground has a () Facebook site it's currently not very maintained, these tips will be really helpful to keeping an audience on the Facebook site interested and engaged.)  

Twitter
Barbican have only had a () presence here for the last 6 months or so but already it has proved successful. According to their analytics they rank in the top 30 arts organisations in the world (6:30 in). The tone on Twitter is even more informal and the conversation currency is fun. They also have played around with the form, recently conducting a successful Q&A with a renowned violinist. They capitalised on this event by taking photos and putting it on the (Flickr site) website.

(conclusions: Twitter needs to be set up and taken seriously, we chatted about it being a potential drain on resources. Maryam keeps this in check and only really responds to Tweets for an hour in the morning and afternoon. This is encouraging as there were concerns raised at the Skype meeting  that Twitter would take up too much time.)  

Last FM
Interestingly someone outside of the Barbican staff started a Last FM presence and still maintains the site, updating and playlists and live sets. According to their analytics Last FM is one of their most successful sites for converting into ticket sales. 

(conclusions: I hadn't even thought of using Last FM. It makes even more sense to compile a playlist and presence for Village Underground as it stages quite a lot of music events. It might also be good to get favourite tracks they think represent Village Underground or even ones that they play whilst working in the office and studio. GAnalytics)

YouTube
Their ()Barbican Channel has gained an incredible amount of recognition due to video footage of their most recent installation featuring bullfinches roosting on a guitar and amp. Although the footage was shot somewhere else it was re-editted by Barbican staff and succeeded on their channel, receiving over 600,000 views. 

[]

Also interestingly the PR team put YouTube links in their press releases and this was also a way that the buzz around this video built up. They have also just started a Vimeo account, the content is the same as YouTube but Vimeo is preferred by designers. This preference was also expressed by the Village Underground designer at the last Skype meeting. Maryam is currently looking at Tube Mogul a service that automatically puts the same content across different third party video sites. At the moment this is a paid for service.

(conclusions: Village Underground needs a Channel, there is plenty of material floating around YouTube but if it is brought into a channel it makes it easier to use and monitor. Use of video also needs to be thought about using it creatively. Maryam also mentioned she wanted to encourage more of a rough and ready approach to video, it's all very well having polished bits of video but the public want to also see exclusives, voxpops and behind the scenes action. These can all be readily done with Village Underground.)

Flickr
Barbican have a broad array of press shots, amateur snaps and even flip footage on their Flickr site. Much of Maryam's work is concerned with encouraging people to tag them up properly. Correctly tagged the images will also show up on the Barbican site's Flickr gallery and Facebook Flickr widget and twitpics, which encourages tagging. Maryam talked about how Flickr is helping to bring all three main sites together. 

(conclusions: pretty much the same as YouTube conclusions, there are pics out there they just need pulling together.)

Blogging
There was some talk about encouraging blogs for certain projects but it very much depends on the personality. I raised the point about what I'd noticed with the Liverpool Philharmonic blog, successful because the chief Conductor is charismatic. Maryam mentioned that person who blogs must be used to doing it, you can't force people to blog.

(conclusions no progression from the notes I made in my first stage research ())

Podcasts
Only a few podcasts have been produced so far but they have already gained recognition. The Barbican team have been told by iTunes that they might be mentioned in next month's Store Picks section. Obviously at the moment the focus is mainly on music but Maryam would like to start producing podcasts for other departments, particularly theatre and maybe even visual arts (discussion!)

(Conclusions: Podcasts might be too time consuming for the limited time that I am able to help Village Underground. However given the right training they are fairly easy to produce, maybe this is an element that can be introduced if an internship were to happen. I could quite easily train someone to produce decent audio)

All In The Analysis
Maryam has many success stories to tell about her approach to online. One overall element which seems key to me though is that the Google Analytics are key to measuring and proving that succes. I need to chat to Jowan the web designer about what analytics are in place and strengthen and consolidate them. What is clear is that there are quite a few piecemeal elements already started to all the social media bits, members of the public and archive material already exist. For my project I need to organise these parts and create a strategy for going forward. ",,

With the deadline passing this week for applications to be part of Jeremy Hunt's distributed local TV plans, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj4pzApu1zk"">we caught up with</a> <strong>Lin Glover</strong> - a regular <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/author/lin-glover"">TheMediaBriefing contributor</a> - who is taking part in this process, to ask what's really going on. Lin is a director at Your TV,  which is hoping to jointly run the new local TV network along with a number of other potential partners.</p>
<p>Glover says the biggest problem with Manchester&rsquo;s Channel M - probably the most successful stand-alone digital station, even though it has been cut to shreds - was <em>timing</em>. Guardian Media Group developed the station on its own and tried to compete with major channels - but didn't have the audience, budget or revenue to compete.</p>
<p>Glover also adds - despite what some people may think about him - Jeremy Hunt is ""<strong>the one of the few people I trust...""</strong></p>

If you're pushing lightbulbs this may be tricky but for someone such as DJ outfit Layo & Bushwacka! it's pretty straight forwards there's obviously a wealth of tracks and mixes to share. They've had a summer residency with Amnesia with Ibiza and a few of their own Shake It events. also as tech savvy music producers they're pretty good at tweeting and updating the fans themselves and collecting their own photos. 

Although we only started their <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/layoandbushwacka"" title=""Facebook page"">Facebook page</a> in June it's seen fairly healthy growth to over 2100 followers. ","random, Uncategorized",

VideoNotes great for research with potential for collaborative journalism,,dandavies23,"h1>History</h1>
<a href=""http://videonot.es"">VideoNotes</a> (launched this month) is a simple online tool that allows you to write notes alongside videos from a variety of sources including Vimeo, YouTube and Coursera. It was developed by <a href=""http://unishared.com/"">Unishared</a>, a French education start-up but <a href=""http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/2013/04/18/tip-videonotes-can-streamline-online-research/"">Journalism.co.uk</a> pointed out how it would be useful for journalists.
<h1>In practice</h1>
I took a <a href=""http://youtu.be/QTFPrQzcKUk"">Data Journalism panel discussion video</a> (below) from the <a href=""http://www.journalismfestival.com/"">International Journalism Festival #ijf13</a> and typed in notes as I watched.

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/QTFPrQzcKUk?list=PLKD4nfGTHZ_OnQhdcF2wRHcXnsmesiGGR"" frameborder=""0"" width=""560"" height=""315""></iframe>

One good thing about this application is that the notes are timecoded, so when you click through them it will take you to the right place in the video. This is particularly useful in conjunction with the YouTube's own timecoded embeds. So, for example if the main focus of your article was the impact of Nate Silver on Data Journalism you could <a href=""http://youtu.be/QTFPrQzcKUk?t=33m6s"">run the discussion from this point</a>. The other great feature of this application is that it stores the information on Google Drive, so you can collaborate on note taking. I've <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/newsint.co.uk/file/d/0Bzch2fAN7q9tc3VEZHV6OS1iZ0U/edit?usp=sharing"">shared these notes</a> with News International so you can add your own comments if you wish.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
Not only is this a good internal research application but  it could potentially be expanded to encourage collaborative and open journalism. Notes could add further context and clarification to a video and allow your audience to understand a story.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
Although this video was created with my News International Google Drive, I think in future I will use my personal Google Drive as current business restrictions mean that I couldn't allow public collaboration on this. Although the note making device is very simple to use, it would be good to see the time codes so that specific key quotes could be more precisely cited. At the moment any attempt to correct this deletes the time code completely.
<h1>Summary</h1>
A useful tool to help guide you through video with a real potential for collaborative journalism.

Write for Dropbox really makes filing on iOS a joy,,dandavies23,"<a title=""Website"" href=""http://writeapp.net/"" target=""_blank"">Write for Dropbox</a> landed this year as a note taking device for Dropobox on iPhone. This month it launched an iPad version which, aside from being the same but bigger, also allows you to pair it with your other iOS device to use either its clipboard or keyboard.
<h1>In practice</h1>
This review is written using the Write for Dropbox app. The first useful thing about this app is that it uses <a title=""Markdown"" href=""http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"" target=""_blank"">Markdown</a> (a less awkward way of writing HTML based on Simpletext) which makes writing for web very quick. The format panel is well thought out and quite good if you want to learn the Markdown short cuts. You can default to a font of your choice without it adding any odd HTML and you can also calibrate for daytime night time display.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
The advantages of filing remotely or using this to take quick notes is clear. There’s no risk of losing the text in a browser window as everything backs-up quickly on Dropbox. It also saves your from the unnecessary steps and hazards of pasting from Word into e-mails. Whilst there are also other apps on the market for Dropbox this one feels iOS native with plenty of speedy swipes and shortcut gestures. You can also share the text in multiple formats and on various social media platforms and back up notes further in Evernote and Google Drive.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
I know it’s only £1.49,but it’s a touch galling to pay for the app twice on both devices, especially since the much-hyped pairing keyboard is a bit pointless. Essentially, you get the more space on the iPad version than on your phone. Also the pairing times out pretty quickly and it’s a bit of battery drain. On the plus side, the Mac version of this app is free and is similarly fast and lightweight.
<h1>Summary</h1>
A well thought out text editor which really makes writing and note taking a pleasure.

A theory of evolution with Vessels’ Martin Teff,"Tue, 09 Jun 2015 14:00:04 +0000",dandavies23,"<p dir=""ltr""><strong>For their third album Vessels have seemingly morphed from rock band that was influenced by dance music to an electronic band that is capable of performing live &#8211; with two drummers. Straight after their performance at Village Underground <a title=""Convergence website"" href=""http://convergence-london.com/"" >as part of Convergence</a>, Dan Davies caught up with guitarist and now techno DJ Martin Teff about musical movement.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">DD: I wondered first of all, whether you were a bit like me and you were guitar-raised as a teenager, and then you discovered dance music?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">MT: Yeah, I mean I used to be quite into loads of metal, up until the point I got to university. It kind of continued but I had this, dual thing of getting into dance music from the age of 18. I think that applies to most of us, if not all of us in the band. We definitely arrived at university, discovered partying and spent lots of times in loads of clubs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">DD: It was also the communal experience of clubbing at that time and everything musically being quite open. Was that where you broadened your horizons, even if you don’t split it up as either rock and dance… did you find it kind of levelled the playing field?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">MT: There was an openness and the community spirit that happened back in those days- the drugs definitely had a part to play in that as well as various other things. But I think back to the kind of things I’m into now and to some degree when you’re younger, you tend to be more open to things. Then you spend a few years deciding what you really like, and then focus some more on those when you grow older.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">DD: Was the move from guitars to drums a line-up decision or was it a taste thing?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">MT: I guess it was just a natural evolution. We decided certain things that helped that process to happen, but I don’t think we necessarily had a clear and distinct vision of what it would end up being. I think at the same time, we were getting slightly bored of post-rock / math rock kind of music. I think we started to feel that we didn’t have as much to add to those things, as maybe other people did. At the same time I think we got a bit tired of dragging round huge amps everywhere &#8211; so there was a conversation around downscaling our set up and being more practical about things we’re going to use, and actually what’s happened is we’ve got not as many big amps, but loads more other stuff! I think the main thing is we were all, to various degrees, listening to electronic music and it just felt like that was the thing we wanted to do more. You can kind of hear the same band, in the new stuff, but I think &#8211; we’ve been listening to a few different things and also just wanted to make a bit of a change in the stuff that we do.</p>
<div id=""attachment_592"" class=""wp-caption alignnone"" style=""width: 1610px""><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/convergenceldn/sets/72157651315313382""><img class=""size-full wp-image-592  "" title=""Vessels at Convergence 2015 opening night by Antonio Pagano"" alt="""" src=""http://vuzine.villageunderground.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/16776743806_2aa0ee068a_h.jpg"" width=""1600"" height=""1068"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">from Convergence 2015 opening night by Antonio Pagano</p></div>
<p dir=""ltr"">DD: How do you resist the urge to get stuck in a- pre-patched kind of stuff when you come to do it live- what keeps the live element going?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">MT: We pretty much try to think about how we would do it live when it’s being written, and occasionally that also gets forgotten. Usually, Lee will write about twenty synth parts that no one would ever be able to play unless we got another fifteen people in the band or something, and basically what we then tend to do is to go back to those tunes and figure out how we’re going to make them work in the live session, and usually that means the vast majority &#8211; 99 per cent of it is still played live. There’s a lot of looping of different parts so you can have multiple things running at the same time,  very occasionally we have to rely on something else to get us through, but it’s almost always played live &#8211; and I think having the guitar and the bass in definitely gives it a kind of organic kind of sound. It definitely has that kind of live-ness to it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">DD: Let’s finish off with the live set up you did here. How did the visuals come about?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">MT: That’s Lee who’s the main songwriter, he’s friends with a sort of professor in Bristol, who was working on the Vectrex hacking image stuff and so we just decided to collaborate and do those visuals for the video and live show.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">DD: Do you all DJ, or will you be doing the majority of the DJ? Or do some of the members of the band take more time on the decks that others?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">MT: It’s mainly me and Lee, and then Tim’s kind of showing a bit of interest at the moment- Lee’s been DJing and doing his own solo dance music for quite a while and I’ve been getting into it in the last couple of years, so we DJ with Kiasmos on the Friday of Convergence.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">DD: I guess you’ve played festivals before- but have you done anything like this where you’ve done something live and then DJ the next day?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">MT: We did a DJ residence at a night in Leeds but so far the DJing’s been more like parties with friends and stuff. Although Lee’s done some cool stuff in Berlin and Barcelona, but doing it as a Vessels DJing thing is a new thing we’re focusing on and we’re pretty excited about doing the Kiasmos thing.</p>

Welcome to the Gutenberg Editor,,dandavies23,"<!-- wp:cover {""url"":""https://cldup.com/Fz-ASbo2s3.jpg"",""className"":""alignwide""} -->

<!-- /wp:cover -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal of this new editor is to make adding rich content to WordPress simple and enjoyable. This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>—somewhat similar to LEGO bricks—that you can move around and interact with. Move your cursor around and you’ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text block</strong> the most basic block of all. The text block has its own controls to be moved freely around the post...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""right""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-right"" style=""text-align: right;"">... like this one, which is right aligned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Headings are separate blocks as well, which helps with the outline and organization of your content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":2} -->
<h2>A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Handling images and media with the utmost care is a primary focus of the new editor. Hopefully, you’ll find aspects of adding captions or going full-width with your pictures much easier and robust than before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""center""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image"">
<figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://cldup.com/cXyG__fTLN.jpg"" alt=""Beautiful landscape"" data-wp-editing=""1"" />
<figcaption>If your theme supports it, you’ll see the ""wide"" button on the image toolbar. Give it a try.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try selecting and removing or editing the caption, now you don’t have to be careful about selecting the image or other text by mistake and ruining the presentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":2} -->
<h2>The <em>Inserter</em> Tool</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the same place on the interface. No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember complicated shortcode syntax. That’s the spirit behind the inserter—the <code>(+)</code> button you’ll see around the editor—which allows you to browse all available content blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already add into your posts that you didn’t know about. Here’s a short list of what you can currently find there:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Text &amp; Headings</li>
<li>Images &amp; Videos</li>
<li>Galleries</li>
<li>Embeds, like YouTube, Tweets, or other WordPress posts.</li>
<li>Layout blocks, like Buttons, Hero Images, Separators, etc.</li>
<li>And <em>Lists</em> like this one of course :)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:separator --><hr class=""wp-block-separator"" /><!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":2} -->
<h2>Visual Editing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A huge benefit of blocks is that you can edit them in place and manipulate your content directly. Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote {""style"":1} -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote"">
<p>The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.</p>
<cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. It’s always easy to add it back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to add a subdued quote as part of the composition of your text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {""ids"":[null,null,null],""columns"":2} -->
<ul class=""wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"">
<li class=""blocks-gallery-item"">
<figure><img src=""https://cldup.com/n0g6ME5VKC.jpg"" alt="""" /></figure>
</li>
<li class=""blocks-gallery-item""> </li>
<li class=""blocks-gallery-item"">
<figure><img src=""https://cldup.com/EKNF8xD2UM.jpg"" alt="""" /></figure>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can change the amount of columns in your galleries by dragging a slider in the block inspector in the sidebar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":2} -->
<h2>Media Rich</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>full-wide</strong> alignments with galleries, you can create a very media rich layout, very quickly:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""full""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image alignfull""><img src=""https://cldup.com/8lhI-gKnI2.jpg"" alt=""Accessibility is important — don’t forget image alt attribute"" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big. But sometimes the image is worth it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {""ids"":[null,null],""align"":""wide"",""images"":[{""url"":""https://cldup.com/_rSwtEeDGD.jpg"",""alt"":""""},{""url"":""https://cldup.com/L-cC3qX2DN.jpg"",""alt"":""""}]} -->
<ul class=""wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped"">
<li class=""blocks-gallery-item"">
<figure><img src=""https://cldup.com/_rSwtEeDGD.jpg"" alt="""" /></figure>
</li>
<li class=""blocks-gallery-item"">
<figure><img src=""https://cldup.com/L-cC3qX2DN.jpg"" alt="""" /></figure>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The above is a gallery with just two images. It’s an easier way to create visually appealing layouts, without having to deal with floats. You can also easily convert the gallery back to individual images again, by using the block switcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any block can opt into these alignments. The embed block has them also, and is responsive out of the box:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/vimeo {""url"":""https://vimeo.com/22439234"",""type"":""video"",""providerNameSlug"":""vimeo"",""align"":""wide"",""className"":""wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-embed-vimeo alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9"">
<div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper"">https://vimeo.com/22439234</div>
</figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/vimeo -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can build any block you like, static or dynamic, decorative or plain. Here’s a pullquote block:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote"">
<blockquote>
<p>Code is Poetry</p>
<cite>The WordPress community</cite></blockquote>

Talk About Local 09,"Sun, 04 Oct 2009 13:29:43 +0000",dandavies23,"Yesterday I evaded all my impulses to stay in bed and instead got on an early train to Stoke to attend the the <a href=""http://talkaboutlocal.org/"">Talk About Local 09</a> non-conference event.

A Staffordshire oatcake soon forced out the hangover out of the way and we got down to business. Caroline Beavon has already published her expansive <a href=""http://carolinebeavon.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/talk-about-local-09-tal09-session-notes/"">notes from the day</a> so I'm going to instead write about what I took from the non-conference.

<strong>Session 1: Making Public Data Public</strong>
It started with a heavy chat about how Making Public Data Public with Director for Digital Engagement – Andrew Stott. Seems to be an ongoing battle with data from different councils having to be cajoled into disseminating data and the data to be available in a useable form. Stott asked everyone to sign up for the developer preview in order to work with the site and suggest where they can go from here.

After a Q&amp;A which mostly involved questions about transparency and legal implications we had a short talk from Chris (@countculture) at <a href=""http://www.openlylocal.com/"">Openly Local.</a> He mentioned how Birmingham's <a href=""http://www.birmingham.gov.uk"">council website</a> is a example of poor thought and data use and how he helped <a href=""http://www.bccdiy.com"">BCC DIY</a> scrape their site.

I've been thinking recently with the election coming up that putting councils online and making the data available to the public is a strong way to make the audience re-engage with politics in an entertaining way. I want to see what's available from Openly Local to move into more journalistic territory.

<strong>Session 2: More Power To Your Blog</strong>
This session was headed up by <a href=""http://pitsnpots.co.uk/"">Pits'n'Pots.</a> A general discussion how it is difficult to be taken seriously by local councils at best and at worst not trusted or completely ignored. A consensus was reached that this seemed to be mostly press officers rather than councillors faults. A press officer from Keele University said ""we're not all bad."" Certainly the attitude differs from site to site and council to council. <a href=""http://thelichfieldblog.co.uk/"">The Lichfield Blog </a>were cited as a success story, not only by cultivating a good relationship with press officers (particularly since the demise of the local paper) but also by breaking local stories nationally - for example the recent discovery of a treasure hoard.

<strong>Session 3: Moderating Comment </strong>
Caroline and I split up after lunch and I attended this session across the road in the Activity Space. Not being in a lecture theatre the session took on a more group discussion dynamic.

Heard from Wolverhampton based blog <a href=""http://www.wv11.co.uk/"">WV11.</a> A likeable couple who wanted to big-up that area but met with endless anonymous negativity. Community website <a href=""http://www.castlebromwich.net/"">Castle Bromwich.net</a> suggested backing up online engagement with physical engagement in a public meeting.

There was an interesting talk about engaging with the youth via <a href=""http://www.typecastawards.co.uk"">Typecast</a> a site which worked with the Police but allowed kids to bust some of their own stereotypes. A good point was also raised that the rating system employed here could be carried to community blog articles, rating system can help diffuse the negativity.

Ed Walker from <a href=""http://www.bloglocal.org.uk"">Blog Local</a> talked about legalities, comments can sometimes be libellous in themselves. Talk about whether Anonymous comments are better or worse. Talk about commentators not being able to hide behind anonymity. But also mentioned that unamed sources can be useful. Also talk about whether bloggers need to follow a code of conduct similar to NUJ. Conclusion reached seemed to be that self regulation is best, you should be able to protect yourself but also know where to get support and advice.

<strong>Session 4: Collaborative Journalism</strong>
Back to the lecture theatre for the final session of the day. Tight time restrictions were imposed on the people left to speak. A few prominent sites were discussed in detail with a sped up presentation by The Guardian's Sarah Hartley about the Future Of Journalism in the middle.

For me the more interesting parts were around this central presentation. Sites that I need to look into more are <a href=""http://www.theyworkforyou.com"">They Work For You</a> and <a href=""http://www.whatdotheyknow.com"">What Do They Know.</a> Ways were discussed how local blogs can use these tools and RSS feeds to investigate.

@Podnosh introduced <a href=""http://helpmeinvestigate.com"">Help Me Investigate</a>. And @Citizensheep also spoke about another Brummie success <a href=""www.bccdiy.com"">BCC DIY</a>. Which made me think about repeating my <a href=""http://dandavies23.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/bcc-diy-audio-interview/"">interview with Stef Lewandowski </a>on this site... or maybe I'll just link it.

I have raw audio from Sessions 1-3 which can be put up without too much trouble. Let me know if you'd like to hear.

<strong>Post event networking</strong>

Made good links with James Clarke from WV11, ended up talking about my Festivals idea. More of that to come on the blog.

Also met with Ed Walker from <a href=""http://www.blogpreston.co.uk"">Blog Preston</a> and Blog Local about his plans to roll out a local blog package and tool kit. More of that soon too!

I was at <a href=""http://24carrots.org.uk/"">24Carrots</a> on Saturday and bumped into two producers asking for our opinions on <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music"">BBC 6Music.</a> I was more than happy to be filmed as 6Music is my favourite radio station. 

I've been listening ever since I got a digital radio for Christmas 6 years ago and pretty much like every show they do (except George Lamb - and I'm not even going to hyperlink that!) but a final thing occurred to me later on that I'd like to share. 

I have this theory that Britpop wouldn't have happened if Radio 1 hadn't brought in the changes they made under Matthew Bannister. The most important element wasn't the notorious clearing of DJ dead wood (which is incidentally why I dislike Lamb, I remember Simon Bates) but the re-invigoration of the playlist. Suddenly eloquent intelligent pop was being listened to by a mainstream audience. Of course it still had to strike a national chord but it was listened to. 

I met <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/marc_riley/"">Mark Riley (AKA The 'Hapless' Boy Lard)</a> at Depercussion Festival in Manchester a few years back and told him how much I liked his 6music show. He was appreciative of my praise but added ""Yeah. but it should be on Radio 1 shouldn't it...""

Many people of my generation have a soft spot for Mark (Radcliffe) and Lard but it wasn't just their sense of humour or deep respect for music but also the breadth of art and literature covered in the show. In fact many people I know have favourite comedians, poets and writers that can be traced back to Mark And Lard. Bannisters changes elevated art to be discussed on air even giving some airtime to comedy shows in their own right for the likes of Collins And Maconie, Lee And Herring - paving the way for the superb Blue Jam by <a href=""http://www.cookdandbombd.co.uk/"">Chris Morris.</a>

I know radio's changed and we're now all filtering our way through our own personalised schedules these days but there's something to be said for a broad range of interesting art to be available on the mainstream. Bringing arts and comedy shows onto 6music might be moving away from the 'music' part of their edict. So where else do we go for our cultural spark? Is it Radio 4 or should it be Radio 1?","BBC 6 Music, British Broadcasting Corporation, Chris Morris, MA Online Journalism, Mark and Lard",
#MobileMedia11: Who is keeping pace in the lightning fast world of mobile media?,"Wed, 11 May 2011 11:27:13 +0000",dandavies23,"<p><em>This is part of a series of articles and interviews on TheMediaBriefing this week ahead of our conference <a href=""http://mobilemedia.themediabriefing.com/"">Mobile Media Strategies 2011</a> on June 14.</em></p>
<p>It may only be three months since we published <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/mobile-strategies"">Mobile Media Strategies for Media Owners</a> but already there have been significant shifts in the digital publishing industry. As the author of the intelligence report Dominic Jacquesson mentions in this video, many of its predictions have come to pass.</p>
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pwJLs26GeA[/youtube]
<h3>Platform changes</h3>
<p>Things are changing fast. Now Research in Motions&rsquo;s Playbook tablet will run Android apps, Nokia is <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/18114689"">no longer</a> producing new phones using its Symbian platform and is working with Microsoft. Apple still dominates with Android in second place but maybe Microsoft can surprise everyone.</p>
<h3>Publisher re-imaginings</h3>
<p>Many national newspapers are really shining on the app front. Jacquesson singles out the <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/companies/financial-times"">FT</a> and New York Times as moving away from the traditional print news-cycle and the trappings of established workflow. Regional newspapers are also &ndash; slowly &ndash; grasping how they can improve their classified adverts and mine the rich geo-location vein that <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/2011-05-08/are-news-media-sat-on-a-mobile-data-goldmine"">Patrick Smith mentioned</a> in thus article.</p>
<p>According to Jacquesson, magazines haven&rsquo;t changed enough and they&rsquo;re still &ldquo;locked in with the design departments&rdquo;. He continues: &ldquo;They need to get their web teams in there and innovate around proper functionality. Re-imagining what magazines should be like for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Price switches</h3>
<p>With <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/companies/hearst-corporation"">Hearst</a> and Cond&eacute; Nast picking up the Apple&rsquo;s new subscription model there&rsquo;s been some speculation that this might force app prices down. But interestingly Jacquesson thinks that the new deal might give stabilise prices. However, he warns if publishers develop for Android apps it could affect overall pricing &ndash; consumers who use Google expect most of their apps for free.</p>
<p>Jacquesson&rsquo;s final message is clear. There are plenty of ways to make money but some real thinking needs to be done about <strong>innovating fast<strong>. If you don&rsquo;t act now there will be a new tech company who will take your audience.</strong></strong></p>

Mixmag DJ Pierre,"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 17:48:22 +0000",dandavies23,"We've been thinking recently about installing some facilities for streaming shows at Village Underground.  My first three month catch up meeting at VU (slideshow to follow) led to us discussing the possibilities of starting a small radio station or video streaming studio.

In the mean time we've been trying out different alliances including <a href=""http://boilerroom.tv/"">Boiler Room</a> through to <a href=""http://www.be-at.tv/"">B@TV</a> whose live stream of Layo and Bushwacka's Shake It! event had 22,000 views. Speed of delivery and exclusivity still have a real value and offering something instantly and live (even with prerecorded elements) can have a huge international audience. Until we get the tools to do this well the best we can do is good partnerships with respected titles with established audiences.
 
Mixmag will be hosting several excellent nights at Village Underground over the next few months and this livestream with Acid House pioneer DJ Pierres was a dry run. I have to say it wasn't live by 1:45AM when I went to bed last night but hopefully something will appear here.

Replicating Snow Fall without copying: experimenting with ScrollKit,"Thu, 30 May 2013 13:17:00 +0000",dandavies23,"The New York Times' <a title=""Snow Fall"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Snow Fall project</a>, an interactive story requiring the reader to 'scroll' through a range of multimedia, had such a profound effect  <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2013/05/10/how-the-new-york-times-can-fight-buzzfeed-reinvent-its-future/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">executive editor Jill Abramson claimed</a> it became a verb in newsrooms with ""all desks"" trying to create something similar. Last week on <a title=""Medium article"" href=""https://medium.com/meta/503b9c22080b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Medium, Cody Brown laid claim</a> to doing just that using Scroll Kit, a startup designed to streamline this process. Brown bragged that although the Snow Fall project took NYT ""months to design"", his only took a ""few hours to recreate"". His Snowfall how-to video and template have since been removed from <a title=""Scroll Kit"" href=""https://www.scrollkit.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Scroll Kit</a>, but the fact remains that this is a powerful open-source web app.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
A multimedia project that gives you complete control and allows you to create content in a few hours is of huge advantage to journalists.
<h1>In practice</h1>
I took an <a title=""Britain's High St in decline"" href=""http://ruvr.co.uk/2013_05_09/Britain-traditional-High-Street-in-decline/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">audio feature my wife produced</a> and combined this with photographs I'd taken. I found the editing tool relatively easy to use once I had figured out how the layers worked. It took me longest to work out the best way to embed audio onto the pages and I eventually used a Flash embed from <a href=""http://audioboo.fm/users/31031/playlists/8033-cold-wash#"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Audioboo</a>.

This app is designed for the new internet experience, allowing content to be seen in all its widescreen glory on all devices. Due to the high res images and content, the project is created in its own microsite. This can then be transferred onto either your own website, or your title's. It takes up to72 hours to for the DNS transfer and to reflect the new url, it can be viewed in this time but the url will be Scroll Kit. <del>You can watch my finished <a title=""Out To Dry"" href=""https://www.scrollkit.com/s/grc7URT/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">project here</a> but I'm going to experiment with the Wordpress plugin.</del> I've now put the story on <a title=""Out To Dry"" href=""http://wp.me/pGYyH-eZ"">this site</a> using the <a title=""Wordpress plugin"" href=""http://vip.wordpress.com/plugins/scrollkit-wp/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wordpress plugin</a>. Hmmm it looks like it's stripped out my Audioboos - <a href=""https://www.scrollkit.com/s/grc7URT/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here it is with audio</a>.

<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
Now that Cody Brown's Snowfall tutorial has been taken down, there are very few how-to guides available so there is a fair amount of guess work. Although the step backwards function (undo for non-tech minded readers) mostly works, occasionally it freezes. On reflection my early pages were a little conservative, I became more confident at full screen photos as I worked through the project. The Audioboo embed was a bit of a fudge and I would like to see the developers integrate audio into the application itself. Also, it's a standard multimedia lesson but I regretted not shooting any video which limited me to the full range of editing options available. I may still pop back and film a washing machine and loop it as the front cover. Despite Brown's brag, this project took me a couple of days not a couple of hours. And although it's close to the Snow Fall model, there are so many careful and considered touches it can be copied but not really replicated.
<h1>Summary</h1>
A really good multimedia presentation tool, but no Snow Fall.

Ben Watt on loops,,dandavies23,"<header class=""entry-header""></header>
<div class=""entry-content"">

<em>In 1983 Ben Watt released his debut album North Marine Drive on indie label Cherry Red. Then he met Tracey Thorn and they formed folk-infused venture <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150913091604/http://www.ebtg.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Everything But The Girl</a>. In the early nineties the band collaborated with Massive Attack and 1996’s Walking Wounded melded with future-facing collaborators Howie B and Spring Heel Jack.  This diversion won Watt a nomination for producer of the year at Q Awards and started a loop into dance music. Thirty years later he’s seemingly back where he started and has finally got round to recording his second solo album.</em>

<strong>You recently won the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150913091604/http://benwatt.com/news/hendra-wins-aim-award-2014"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">difficult second album award</a>, did it <em>feel</em> difficult or were you just diverted for 30 years?</strong>

The album had been in the back of a mind on and off for years. I had an emerging career aged nineteen back in the early eighties. I had recorded with folk mavericks like Kevin Coyne and Robert Wyatt in spite of my relative youth. Then I met Tracey and took a fork in the road. I thought it would be for three months. It took 20 years. But someday I knew I would return to a solo record of some sort. In the end I wrote it out of a kind of compulsion because of certain triggers in my life, and I just tried to be natural, true to my earliest influences, relaxed, with good stories to tell. Yes, there were moments when I felt daunted by it all, but I guess I have always been a person who opens the lion’s mouth and sticks my stupid head in.

<strong>In what way does the new album echo where you were at the beginning 30 years ago?</strong>

The interface of folk and Brazilian and rock still fascinates me. I grew up discovering artists like Joao Gilberto, John Martyn, Nick Drake, Neil Young and they still leave a big imprint on me now. Back then no one was talking about Nick Drake. Unlike now. And my dad – a big band arranger and jazz composer – was always playing jazz in the house. I also listened to mid 70s Eno stuff like Before and After Science and Another Green World. I loved the ambient textures, the buzzing polysynths. We used that as background texture on Hendra.

<strong>As you’ve completed your 20-year musical orbit around electronic music what is your relationship with it now?</strong>

I was completely absorbed by it for a long time. But somehow I hit a plateau a couple of years ago. Things seemed to be either running out of control with EDM, or returning to where I was at the beginning of my DJing with people asking me to play all my early Lazy Dog deep house records again, or elsewhere I saw young bands and duos mining the jagged electronic pop seam Everything But The Girl worked at in the mid-nineties. It felt like a turning point. I had no desire to commercialise <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150913091604/http://www.buzzinfly.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Buzzin’ Fly</a> nor did I want to spool back ten or fifteen years, so I hit the pause button, and realised what I really wanted to do was write again – words, songs. Another beginning perhaps, perhaps even an older one, but it felt like a fresh one.

<strong>What’s your creative process?</strong>

I never plan. I never second guess. I just wait for ideas to mass up and then I commit. Always out of a need. Sometimes I work on something and realise it is actually the middle of a good idea and it needs a start and endpoint. In the end, you just hope to impress yourself in some way. And that gets harder.

<strong>For Hendra did you work from your home studio or did songs come to you when you were elsewhere with a guitar?</strong>

I wrote everything for that record on one guitar or at the piano. I did basic old school demos. Tried to make sure they worked as songs in the raw form first.

<strong>Is there any electronic residue left behind?</strong>

Yes, me and Ewan (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150913091604/http://ewanpearson.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pearson</a>) spent a long time on the background electronic textures on the record. The opening of the album actually starts with a heavy ARP chord, but we also used found sounds, old polysynths, vintage Solina all over the album if you listen. Often it is there creating subliminal mood – fizzing and buzzing around the edges. Nathaniel has some serious motorik drum programming behind the real drums. Wait till you hear the extended edits Ewan has done of it that we are releasing next month!

<strong>How did it feel taking centre stage again for the live performances?</strong>

I have always loved being on a stage. It doesn’t phase me. The first comeback show – in a friend’s record store in Indianapolis after hours in April 2013 – was nervewracking but I soon fell back into it again.

<strong>Solo albums can be singular pursuits but this album has some great contributions. How important to you is collaboration with good musicians?</strong>

I turn to people when I need them. I knew I was writing in a very loose impressionistic – and at times melancholy – way on the record, and yet the lyrics were quite heavy, so I decided I needed a counterpoint in the music, a darker voice, some grit. And that is how I turned to Bernard Butler. He brings the edge, the distortion, the foil.

<strong>How did the Ben Watt Trio come about? At what point did Bernard Butler and Martin Ditcham get involved?</strong>

Bernard has been playing with me since I began this whole project. My first comeback shows last August in Clerkenwell were with Bernard alongside. So he is integral. I have known Martin for years. A brilliant percussionist and drummer. He played on the album and has been on Everything But The Girl stuff in the past. I like building atmospheres with few components. Two guitars and drums is intriguing to me. And different. We can rework a few of the songs in a new way. Stick to arrangements but also improvise.

<strong>How big an impact did Amplified Heart have on your electronic trajectory?</strong>
It was the first time me and Tracey started mixing our songs with breakbeats and samples. We began the album in 1993. The producer John Coxon was very instrumental in helping us along that road. I still love the original version of Missing that we did with him. But obviously Todd Terry’s remix and the work we did with Massive Attack at the same time showed how it could really translate to a wider audience. We stepped up through the gears in nineties with some confidence after that. Making Walking Wounded in 1995 was very exciting – a new dawn in many ways. We were already a band already ten years into their career. Not many bands get the chance to break through big with something new. Looking back, it was like like the Bee Gees or something.

<strong>What motivated you to start DJing at Lazy Dog, was it wanting to share exciting dance music with people?</strong>

Everything But The Girl were playing big shows by the end of the nineties. It was starting to feel too big. Also Tracey was feeling the urge to break away and start a family. In the end we decided to call it a day on a high point and I wanted to go back onto the underground and start something new and fresh. I bumped into Jay Hannan who worked at Blackmarket Records in Soho. We dreamed up the night. Deep house on a Sunday afternoon-thru-evening. No one was doing it back then. Sunday clubbing was in its infancy. It took eighteen months to build but when it took off it was one of the best five years of my life.

<strong>Why did you want to start Buzzin’ Fly, was it an insatiable urge bring electronic music to an enthusiastic audience?</strong>

I was just immersed in at all at that point. People would hand me great tracks and I thought it would be great to help put them out. Then one of my own productions, Lone Cat, which had been made for Lazy Dog play only was bootlegged off one of only fifty white labels I’d made for friends, and suddenly a couple of thousand were kicking up a storm and I was getting calls from New York about it. I realised that was the moment to act. I got control back of the track and released it properly. That was the first release on Buzzin’ Fly in 2003.

<img class=""alignnone"" src=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150913091604im_/http://www.enface.gr/wp-content/uploads/ben-watt.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""768"" />

<strong>The plateau of creativity you’ve said you reached in 2011 – was there a specific day or moment when you felt you had to return to writing and performing live?</strong>

Not really. It creeps up on you. The late nights, the travelling, the disappointing DJ gigs – you start to resent them, rather than brush them aside. And the
office hours were long too. In the end I felt my own self-expression was being stifled in some way. I needed a change.

<strong>What irks you so much about EDM?</strong>

The name is the worst thing. The American music industry was always rubbish at respecting its own underground electronic movements. You could argue America is the home of house, techno, early disco – and yet at a mainstream level – none of them were respected or understood or given grassroots support. In the end all of it was lumped together in a huge rebranding exercise when the big players and labels realised a firestorm was brewing as various things came together – the underground teen rave scene, organised corporate-sponsored festivals, superstar Djs, laptop producers, mash-ups – and saw the money that could be made out of its worst excesses.

<strong>On the flipside, do you miss DJing regularly and creating electronic music? Do you find yourself drawn to other ways of using technology in your life or has it all gone very puritan?</strong>

Puritan is a strange word to use; I know plenty of techno puritans if you want to put it like that. I am just a musician who responds to the things around me and tries to be always inspired not just playing by numbers. I don’t want to fake it. At the moment wood, steel, amplifiers, words are exciting to me. I don’t miss Djing at the moment but that’s not to say I won’t ever go back to it. Everything is a cycle.

<strong>Do you feel like you have any unfinished business?</strong>

Always. Everything you ever do is done to make up for perceived mistakes in the past.

<strong>If you could live any year of the last 31 again, which one would it be?</strong>

None. The next one is always the best.

When Journalists Kill,"Fri, 23 Oct 2009 10:58:21 +0000",dandavies23,"After a long day at <a href=""http://www.hellodigital.net/"">Hello Digital</a> I went over to <a href=""http://www1.aston.ac.uk/staff/aspects/events/ben-goldacre/"">Aston University</a> to listen to a talk by Dr Ben Goldacre of <a href=""http://www.badscience.net/"">Bad Science</a> fame. 

Although the title of the lecture was 'When Journalists Kill' it was a suitably freewheeling, humourous and passionate talk which spiralled on for 40 minutes beyond the allocated time. His general theme was how poor reporting, based on misinformation and poor investigation is extremely dangerous. Along the way various cod scientists, nutritionists and new agers get suitably lampooned! 

Ben has asked me not to publish the recording, at least until he's finished touring it. He's more than happy to do an interview with me, so keep an eye out for that! In the mean time he's given me permission to steal this 2007 Brighton Science Festival recording from his site.

But, even though I wrote about them for Metro, I’ve been forced to miss several of their gigs. Instead only catching snatches of them energetically leaping around on YouTube.

This week, despite having a tiring day at uni, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to finally to see them unpixellated. The Belfast-based lads were supporting This Will Kill You so I went down nice and early and got myself pressed up against the barrier in an active attempt to relive my teenage years. I've mostly moved away from rock bands in the last 10 years but there's something about this band that stirs the young rock beast inside me.

Only against the barrier can you see flying splinters from shattered drumsticks, the sweat dripping from bent heads onto their guitars. They band's name might imply considered distance but the only way to watch the band up-close in full visceral effect.

"Maps, Hare And Hounds, Kings Heath, 25/10","Mon, 26 Oct 2009 08:21:37 +0000",dandavies23,"<strong>“Cycling to MAPS with new bike lights”</strong>

Was the first Tweet I sent out as I cycled up to <a href=""www.hareandhoundskingsheath.co.uk"">Hare And Hounds, Kings Heath </a> last night. My father-in-law had come round in the daytime and fixed my bike whilst I locked myself away in the study trying to get my head around Pixel Pipe. The up-hill pedal to the venue was an absolute pleasure. Nothing rattled for a change and I had brand new lights – one  attached to my bike and another pinned to the strap of my camera bag – to guide my way.

I may have lost some of my cool by accidently leaving the camera bag flashing light on as I wandered up to the bar. But my mobile LED disco may have added further <em>ambiance </em>to <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/arcvel"">Arc Vel's</a> superb set. The new solo project from the former (much missed) <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/grandscope"">Grandscope</a> member was aided by his own visuals, which according to another former Grandscope member Hydey, had taken a week and a half to pull together.

<strong>“Gutted only caught last song by Tour Eifel, quality electronica with home made visuals”</strong>

Arc Vel should have been second not first as the next act didn’t really compliment the shoegazing frug of Maps instead being a falsetto voiced navel-gazing guitar player called It Hugs Back... hmmm.

<strong> “Maps kick off with It Will Find You followed by Papercuts” </strong>

A strong start indeed, James Chapman has now employed ‘a Dane’ to add extra texture on tour. It sounds superb and the new material swims happily alongside the old. About five songs in Chapman speaks and it’s then that I realise that he’s pretty ratted.

<strong>“Maps (chap)man is smashed but septembers provide more than ample support”</strong> I Tweet.

And the fact I didn’t spot that predictive text made that message partially incoherent indicates my state too. It’s a funny situation actually that someone like Ozzy Osbourne can spend the best part of his music career off his face but live electronic acts should always be sober and serious whilst they prod away at a laptop. I blame Kraftwerk.

<strong>“At some point in the near future you're going to choose between another pint or an album from Merch. How depressing is that?”</strong>

I Tweet before I head to the Merch store and find out that the new album is a <em>tenner</em>.  It is signed though, and quality is worth paying for. Besides my freewheeling downhill cycle saves forking out on a taxi and is about 30 times more enjoyable.

Monetising micro local</strong>

No one is selling content - What are they selling?
Platform: About My Area - pay to have hyper local platform
Ads: half hyper local efforts are selling adverts - more using Addiply service
Services: Talk About Local blog itself not making money effectively - helping authorities and PR services and unions with Social Media strategy
Products: t-shirts mugs events BiNS

Low cost = low profits
Multiple revenue streams - print is high cost entry and high profits so spread out streams - NY blog quarter comes from events
New effiiciencies - collaborating with audience process as product broker audience and vendor
New advertising models - based on performance big per thousand people click or complete a sale - Goggle sells on performance
Legacy as handicap

Decoupling + end of monopoly
People never paid for news they paid for package
Niche advertising separate from prices
Platform already paid for
Membership - engage in that online community
Convenience
The 90 degree shift - moving from vertical to horizontal  - spend 3 hours 40 on community sites- 2 minutes on newspaper- starting to engage with online communities

Independent’s view
Networked approach - being covered elsewhere I won’t cover it. Link is the content
Process as product - activity of going around area becomes content
Quality not quantity - spend a week on it because think it’s worth more

<strong>AOP Microlocal Media Forum Part 2
Presentation: Roger Green Newsquest</strong>

Speaking for himself not necessarily Newsquest (NQ)
Current media model more robust than given credit for - lots of things tried over the last few years
Nevertheless NQ now compete with zero cost players

NQ cover 150 sites who have alligence with local
Use media brands they have run through central system at local level: enablers for local people
Engaging with audience they have grown consistently
Amount of time people spend interacting
Websites but also telephone calls and texting
Westmorland Gazette: huge growth in audience significant spike when news event kicks off - ie. recent flood coverage

Big challenge= less dictating and more collaborative process
Very hard to motivate community correspondence - fill newsgathering and information gaps - channel needs to be worked hard. In Bingley, Betty Newell is the local contact works information

Involving people in more of the stories that matter, Basildon Echo (Basildon Uni Hospital story) 15 significant comments added to the story by the time it wound down 60 comments which moved narrative on
Compared to BBC local story couple of interviews were getting recycled so didn’t really engage with evolving story
NHS project attempting to bring together information - but only a few comments since 2007

Can do local without news - very brave according to RG
Almost all of it catefully integrated - geocoded - doing more than is appreciated
Newpapers to local regional media brands

Adoption of Twitter - Cover It Live
Watford Observer: @Observer_Owl
Turfed out of office and worked remotely routinely work out of cafes: cafes approve good cache from it
Get more local stories out of it
Won’t claim every editorial group as equally adept at taking on these tools
Lancashire used Twitter anti-terrorist movement via Twitter
Brighton: Jo Wadsworth leading field in terms of followers to following therefore she listens as well as talks

Tactics for Publishers
Adopt tools and use effectively
Make up own mind but don’t be disco dad: nothing that is zero cost can be sustainable - make up mind on what matters ignore everything else
Geocoding not always necessary, must be relevant to story
Observe decent analytics
Be commercial - not just about journalism even not a lot, publishing, distribution and sales
Be prepared to partner- Bloggers can be ‘upset by partner arrangements’ especially if on terms of the partner - partnerships need to behave in humble fashion
Not sustainable don’t bother: no point in a shiny local website launched by a publisher around one news event. Hardly any coverage of major news events, even worse covered better in Wall St Journal
If already have some great local media brands then maybe not worth launching at all

Two way conversation - but no-one found a decent way of monetizing e-mail
Based around popular social networks: Scope to get more out of community correspondence - open to talk to anyone ’we can help monetize that type of publishing’

Roger Green ‘Look forward to partnering or taking you on’

<strong>Q&amp;A Discussion

Panel
David Higgerson: Trinity Mirror
James Thornett : BBC Local
Lori Cunningham Johnston Press
Roger Green: Newsquest
Paul Bradshaw: BCU Lecturer Help Me investigate</strong>

<em>What new skills need in micro local:</em>
LC: Curration and oversight and a two way dialogue to bring forward
JT: Curration much more aware of market out there, awareness of local personalities - less about the brand and the company more about the people themselves
DH: Much more aware of impact of what they say and way say it. Journalists more open minded about the way to tell the story
PB: Social capital - contributing to their community being a participant. Understand distribution networks. Distribution part of journo’s role
RG: Can’t really add. Listening very important skill and distribution - related links to things

<em>Struck idea of platform how people produce outside whether it’s a priority. Predicated on whether there is a destination but the assumption people won’t go to specific site...</em>

RG: look for places to pick up content as feeds. Most people who use sites are regular users

<em>Paywall</em>
LC: not one approach - it's an evolving landscape, people are arriving through different manner. More consistent loyal users. As an experiment we've put 3 titles behind pay wall. Understand what dynamics are, quickest way to measure dynamic is to try it out.
<em>
Whether panel do pay to get information</em>
LC: Wall St Journal
JT: No
PB: Bearded Magazine
RG: worth looking into Telegraph used to subscribe to Wall St Journal then Murdoch said would be free so never renewed.

<em>Partnerships: are you going to pay for information from other sources</em>
RG: Almost other way round with bigger companies in NQ experience. We do pay for information.
DH: Case by case basis.
LC: Fragmented network partnership which works with person.
<em>
What assurances do you have that BBC not threatening competition for local publishers?</em>
JT: BBC local broadcasting as the state funded broadcaster are funded to deliver what the UK want. UK popular website, whole ecosystem would work together. BBC do have a sizeable audience in terms of traffic. We are in the same space, find a way to make ecosystem work.

<em>Whether BBC are against pay wall?</em>
LC: We have a viable parntership with BBC. But we see them as a threat. Well funded organisation coming into an area or two guys in a garage. There’s no easy path forwards.
RG: Wouldn’t add to that. Except to observe if not for BBC we’d all be working for Google.
PB: BBC if pulled out of local would be accused as ’London centric’ Needs to justify licence fee. Would like to BBC adding in certain areas. Similar to what PA doing.
DH: Would like to see BBC come good and link back to content.
JT: BBC local are county level publishing - not local on the internet. Works well for us.
<em>
Chris PA: Can you monetize atomised news?</em>
PB: No don’t think you can. Have to look what people use news for. Distribution channels are quite high, difficult to make money no point buying in atomised news. Can’t charge for stickers in playground.
JT: BBC will look at buying picture or video.
DH: Could do better at following up people who lift content word for word. Sunday Mercury does need to chase. Maybe go after the sites that take that copy.

<em>What about people who have blogs who don’t want to be citizen journalists still worth partnerships?</em>
DH: Could work more closely with local sites. Exploring partnerships and what can give back. Perception that newspaper websites are nicking content from hyper local or papers considering sites are run by ‘sid nutters’ - Will Perrin.
<em>
Local versus location - is there a difference in definition?</em>
PB: Yes. Legacy issues of local publishing. Online 3rd of audience is from outside area or people who used to live in the area. Opportunity to capitalise on that. Newspapers haven’t done a lot around monetizing ’location’.
LC: Of great interest. Looking to evolve something along these lines. Make sure syndicated commercial opportunities. Our publishing experience used to defined by geography not the case online. Bring those people together across boundaries.
JT: Trap not to fall into, unique set of location interests and personal interests spread across the country. The next step is personalisation of a set of content through mobile devices and small laptops disseminating news specific to location.

<em>Advertising revenue stream, how demonstrate to advertisers money is well spent?</em>
LC: Process of rolling out idea. How getting people to engage with sites how people coming to us. Thinking traditionally - build up local database not had before.
DH: Area need to explore more. Lot of advertising know going to business community. Northumberland- long ago trailing Addiply coming back time and time again. Now seeing more good than bad examples.
RG: The advertising we do carry is pretty accountable enough. Methods of selling if we were to sell for micro local.

Spaghetti Junctions #1,"Fri, 08 Jan 2010 10:43:32 +0000",dandavies23,"I'm currently working on game based around a kind-of psycho-geographic version of the 'six degrees of seperation' idea. Basically, the game encourages players to (tenuously) link together Birmingham facts and myths. Here's a version played on Google Wave before Christmas:  

[wave id='googlewave.com!w%252Bbh7I02lyA']

It was quite fun but as you can see it collapsed when we used Wave to discuss 'the process' of the game. And I couldn't engage enough people in Wave to make it worthwhile.

It might be more appropriate to run it in Twitter but I think before I jump on there I want to work out how to get people understand how the game runs. I was thinking I might put some rules up either here or on #Brum site. 

If it has a click through Wordpress page to I might be able to take the game to a second stage and prove or disprove the facts or myths, offering more background and links away from the focus of gameplay. This might be the journalism but the degree of proven truthfulness could be used as a points system of sorts. 

Well there's still a lot to work through... Would love to hear what you think of this idea, or if you have any strong opinions on the following questions then speak your brains below... 

Is Twitter the best place to run the game?
Should I be wary of too many rules?
Any ideas how I can get more folk involved?
Should there be a live geo-tagging picture version - and might that get you extra points?
Is there anything we can use to graphically show the facts so it represents a load of spaghetti links?","#Brum, Birmingham, games, hashbrum, Journalism, MA Online Journalism, myths, Social Media, socialmedia",

<strong>Part 1 – Pedalling The Raw Data</strong>

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/245.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-291"" title=""Fort Dunlop 'P'"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/245-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

This feature began with a simple observation, I'd started hearing and reading more news stories where cyclists had been involved in accidents. This interested me because I had been cycling into work. Working at Metro Newspapers at Fort Dunlop, I considered pitching a story to Birmingham Post about commuter cycling so I filed a Freedom Of Information (FOI) request on road deaths involving cyclists in the West Midlands.

When I started this course I began to think about different ways in which story could be told. My FOI request came through and I decided to map the deaths. I felt mapping could graphically represent the accidents which would help cyclists think about how they ride in that area. However, my FOI request had a significant flaw, the accidents were not located.

I put the FOI on the HashBrum site alongside the map and set about trying to find the accident locations via news stories and police reports. I also launched an investigation on <a href=""http://bit.ly/5agnST"">Help Me Investigate</a>.

<em>“The first step in community organizing is to listen… you show that you are willing to not only listen to other voices in your online community, but to amplify them. That takes you into the second step in community organizing, building relationships.”(<a href=""http://www.ojr.org/ojr/people/robert/201001/1810/"">Niles</a>)</em>

I responded to each comment and I hope I succeeded in what Axel Bruns would call “dialogic, conversational, unfinished news” (2005, 53.) People showed me other experiments that were taking place, other data that was available and successful national mash-up maps.

I was encouraged by the different experiments taking place but they all stopped short of what I wanted for HashBrum. Dave Harte showed me a mash-up created by <a href=""http://bit.ly/4TSmaq"">Times Online</a> made from data which had been passed to me the day before. In December, I was shown a UK Crash Map on the <a href=""http://bit.ly/75JRkD"">BBC site</a>. They were expansive but I wanted something more local and with more detail.

I was told about a similar investigation that was taking place in <a href=""http://bit.ly/7KFfmt"">New York</a> but no results had been mapped. Hannah Waldram was inspired by my experiment and launched a similar Help Me Investigate for Cardiff which I duly joined.

<em>“Digital age journalism is now also interactive. Until recently it was a one-way process... this is no longer the case. Discussion and debate over all kinds of issues is enhanced by the digital age.” (Herbert 2000, 2)</em>

I also received attention from the cycling community in Birmingham, including CTC and <a href=""http://birminghamcyclist.ning.com/"">Birmingham Cyclist Blog</a> and they both started following me on Twitter. One person who runs the Birmingham bike forum also contacted me in the New Year when a cyclist was involved in a serious collision in Solihull; I worked this fact into my story.

However, I was frustrated that I, or anyone else for that matter, couldn't find the older news stories to corroborate the FOI stats I had. I spotted another US site called <a href=""http://www.bikewise.org/"">Bikewise</a> they seemed to have access to full police reports.

I went hunting for other data. I discovered a site called SMIDSY (Sorry Mate I Didn't See You) a campaign launched by the Cycle Touring Club (CTC) which encouraged cyclists to report near misses and even get legal advice. I asked the administrator if I could access their data, they refused but were encouraging about the investigation. They offered some tips such as 'the cycling community prefers using the terms crash or collision rather than accident.'

I decided the only data I could use was the UK government statistics. I decided I could marry the Birmingham pinpoints up with some of the missing FOI accidents. Following our mapping lesson I looked into ways to put these stats on a map and then limit it to the Birmingham area.

I launched another task using Help Me Investigate and spent many hours converting the stats to Longitude and Latitude and trying different sites that could accept a large amount of data. I tried Mapalist, Many Eyes, Google Earth Pro but I couldn't convert them. I contacted @Psychemedia a mash-up specialist but couldn't get it to work. When I disappeared into the world of Python I had to give up.

This is the opposite of Foust and Hathaway:

<em>“Not only can such interactivity increase the community's interest in topics of importance, it also can increase the particular news organization's standing in the community by providing a sense that it listens to its audience”(2005,13)</em>

This was also confirmed with a post by <a href=""http://bit.ly/7JU32X"">Robin PC</a> on the Help Me Investigate site. I realised that in pursuit of mashing-up available data, I had lost focus on why I was making the map. I responded to Robin’s post saying his comments would help my feature.

I took stock of my actions and put a summing up post on the <a href=""http://bit.ly/4oqwGs"">HashBrum site</a>. The purpose of this was to allow the public to see how I had reacted to various comments and what my plans were. I had to redesign the first post so that people visiting the site could navigate their own way.

<em>“Because the Web can be either linear or non-linear, web journalists will have to understand both concepts and be skilled enough to present information in both forms.” (Stovall, Allyn and Bacon 2004, 42)</em>

I cut the original post down to encourage contribution to the map still and provided a logo-link to SMIDSY.

<em>“For the Web journalist, it needs to be lateral. The journalist needs to ask 'How can the story expand?'”(Stovall, Allyn and Bacon 2004, 63)</em>

I decided to start gathering my own data and humanised my story by getting on my own bike, inspired by a feature in <a href=""http://bit.ly/8ES4Wd"">Guardian Society</a>. I realised that an old bike that I inherited was perfectly adapted to snow conditions for reasons explained in the <a href=""http://bit.ly/8K5i4O"">Audioboo</a>. I was also playing with new technology having ordered an Android phone after Christmas. I attempted to take pictures from the journey and send them whilst cycling mobile via Pixelpipe and Tweetorium.

The idea was to not only give the story a human angle but also peak peoples’ interest. I teased Snow Bike on Twitter with links that lead to The Boo or pictures. In its raw form, this multimedia project lived on my blog. My bitly ratings were pushed up as other people on Twitter including @benjibrum and @kevingilmartin retweeted it. I also commented on the Guardian website which produced traffic for my site as well.

I installed an application onto my phone called Sportsrunner which tracked my journeys. Although it was a sporting device that highlighted speed trials and personal bests, it did allow for comment notes section. I was, therefore, able to write a little about each track and mention any hazards I saw. I then transposed these hazards onto the map. I put up a post on HashBrum and also encouraged people on the Birmingham Cycling site to contribute if they could get the technology.

I bought a Kodak Zi8 and decided that I would test Robin PC's claim that the best way to avoid an accident is to make sure you are seen by motorists. He suggested cycling further away from the kerb, so I decided to put this to the test using a Flip Mount on my handlebars. I was on Snow Bike that day, which gave me something extra to talk about. I then edited the footage down and published it on YouTube. I also commented on a <a href=""http://bit.ly/8jFboG""> Podnosh</a> post on Flip cameras which again drove some traffic to this site where I displayed the story alongside a map tracking my progress using <a href=""http://bit.ly/77DGl1"">VideMap</a>. The story was fragmenting across platforms and I liked it.

<em>“News, in other words, is no longer made up simply of a complete, self contained news item, but breaks into a series of primary reports (for example of updates as they unfold, or of various news items written from different perspectives) background information, discussion, commentary, and related and further information.” (Bruns 2005 218)</em>

I tied various multimedia parts together on another HashBrum post, moving from mapping the stats to tracking my progress. I grabbed another perspective on safety and the kerb rule when I got my bike chain fixed. I then compiled my Robin PC footage together.

I discovered an American site called <a href=""http://therightride.org/""> The Right Ride</a> which mapped hazards. It was fairly straight forwards but pointed out all black spots, bad roads and potholes. Most importantly the comment voice seemed to be coming from the community. This encouraged me to take a follow an idea from Hannah Waldram's investigation and produce a mash-up with FixMyStreet.

I looked for an RSS about potholes in Birmingham. There was no recent news in the feed but there were unresolved pothole problems on the site. I asked FixMyStreet if they knew a way to mash RSS with Googlemaps. They didn't but they sent me an <a href=""http://bit.ly/7DkAAJ"">RSS mash-up</a> of all local problems in Birmingham. I set up an e-mail alert for the Pothole RSS feed and am now able to click through on their updated Google Map and save to my Cycle Map. All ongoing problems are marked in pink with a dot or without a dot if it is unconfirmed. I let <a href=""http://bit.ly/5t2gxM"">Hannah Waldram know</a> about my discovery.

Just before my assignment was due in I thought of another way to spin the story as <a href=""http://bit.ly/4UIGdz"">more potholes</a> were popping up due to the bad weather which I think encouraged others to complain through FixMyStreet and furthermore the map.

I am reasonably happy with my feature and I've certainly learnt a lot through keeping my mind open and letting the audience dictate some of the way. However, I feel some traction has been lost in me discovering the story's direction alongside the audience. For my next news piece I want to show my working less on the site. I find myself agreeing with Janet Koldzy  <em>“Research or gathering background information and material, can make a difference between a routine news story and one that attracts and audience and keeps it reading, listening, watching and interacting.” (2006, 107)</em>

Since December I've become interested in the idea of introducing game dynamics into news features.

<em>“Could newspapers similarly harness the human need for interaction and stimulation and sell not just boring text news but access to a shared experience?” (<a href=""http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-the-wow-paywall-what-newspapers-can-learn-from-orcs-and-dwarves/"">Smith</a>)</em>

Rosales also writes on the subject in a short chapter devoted to the subject (2006, 25-27).

I've been working on one idea called Spaghetti Junctions. I performed a Google Wave dry run with Andrew Brightwell. I <a href=""http://bit.ly/55qWCZ""> blogged about this</a> in January and Jon Bounds expressed an interest in helping out.

Bounds and I fleshed out the idea. The basic premise is you claim facts about Birmingham - these can either be true (or Chinns named after local historian Carl Chinn) or entertaining myths (or Bulls named after the Birmingham Bull). Points are gained for either. More points are gained if you can connect two facts via a Spaghetti Junction. To keep traction I've already prepared some facts which can drop in.

Unfortunately, I couldn't run through this experiment this semester as the next stage will require a heavily adapted Wordpress site. I fully intend to do it soon though. It would certainly be an interesting way to pass on and source information. We even decided that more points could be scored if you presented a recent newsworthy fact. Maybe this was something Bruns had in his mind when he talked about Kovach and Rosntiel,

<em>“These new characteristics of the Mixed Media Culture are creating what we call a new journalism of assertion, which is less interested in whether something is true and more interested in getting it into public discussion.” (2005, 57)</em>

There’s also a chance that we can make this game geo-located, linking facts to places on a map. If the player reports a 'fact' from the spot itself then I believe it might be edging towards what <a href=""http://jag.lcc.gatech.edu/blog/2009/12/local-community-games-picture-the-impossible.html"">Espen Aarseth</a> calls a ‘Community Game’ (2009).","Andrew Brightwell, Birmingham, Carl Chinn, cycling, Hannah Waldram, Jon Bounds, MA Online Journalism, Online Journalism assignment, Pothole",
Enhancing My Silver Skins Podcast,"Mon, 15 Mar 2010 12:27:10 +0000",dandavies23,"<a href=""https://www.udressme.co.nz/""><img src=""http://dandavies23.wordpress.com/files/2008/07/supersonic-couple.jpg?w=224"" alt=""formal dresses nz"" width=""224"" height=""300"" class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-283"" /></a>

When I started producing my Silver Skins podcast, I was often asked whether I'd cleared the music copyright. My argument was far from comprehensive, usually involving an explanation that I always talk over the beginning and end of my tracks in traditional 'Radio 1 Top 40' style. I also mumbled that much of my music is new material which is benefiting from exposure to a niche 'older but still cool' audience. 

Silver Skins is a receptacle for music that I am passionate about. The intention behind the podcast was to appeal to a generation who, like me, still loved music and refused to be knocked into any kind of middle-age music box. The passion part also has a lot linked to my ideas behind Blowback: this isn't cycnical aloof abstraction about music industry trends but genuinely wanting to play the best music I experience - and pass on that experience. I've had fans of the podcast contact me, claiming that since listening to the show, they have gone out and bought the album, or seen the musician live. I've recently discovered this opinion is shared by UK Podcasters Association and was backed up by <a href=""http://www.ukpa.info/2008/08/22/the-new-mcps-prs-podcast-license/"">The 2008 MCPS-PRS Podcast License.</a>

For a while I've sided with <a href=""http://www.newmusicstrategies.com/2008/12/31/why-give-music-away-for-free/"">Andrew Dubber's view on copyright, </a>musicians should benefit from exposure rather than try and claw back the potential money they might have been lost. Nevertheless, in a world where people are illegally uploading and downloading entire movies or albums I very much doubt PRS would be interested in the one compressed track that I rabbit all over. But if the request does ever come, I will take it down.

In the mean time, I might be able to offer one further justification. I was inspired by Mixmag's <a href=""http://www.mixmag.net/podcast"">excellent podcast</a> which provides enhanced capabilities. The fact that you can click on an image if playing in iTunes, (or possibly even on iTouch or iPhone - yet to test) you could buy the track in full from the store. 

With my Enhanced Silver Skins, these are all bitly short links, so I will be able to measure how many people click through to the store as a result of listening to my podcast. Hopefully my case will be strengthened by recent reports that <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62E1PM20100315"">paid for downloads have boosted music sales.</a> 

There are other enhanced treats aswell, so have fun downloading and let me know what you think of the tweaked podcast. At the moment I realise that this podcast is a bit Apple-centric so if you have any idea of how I can reproduce the same effect in PC and on other audio devices then please let me know.

What Village Underground can learn from the Barbican,"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 11:07:38 +0000",dandavies23,"For my MA Online Journalism I'm conducting a Production Lab placement with Village Underground, London. Following the last group <a href=""http://productionlab.posterous.com/minutes-from-village-underground-skype-meetin"">Skype meeting,</a> I thought it would be useful to do a case study on a venue that already has its online presence sorted. I managed to arrange a face to face meeting with Maryam Ashgari from the Barbican, a 28 minute edit of the meeting can be listened to below.

[audio: http://dandavies23.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/barbicanedit.mp3]

But if you don't have half an hour to spare here are my conclusions.

<!--more-->

<strong>Website</strong>
The <a href=""http://www.barbican.org.uk/"">Barbican website</a> in its current state has been running for 9 months so it is a relatively new introduction. Maryam is still monitoring the success of her online experiments - the social media and content production process is still evolving. The main website now highlights and flags up a range of things that come up under the broad Barbican umbrella and it is also Maryam's job (in conjunction with an intern) to maintain other social media and keep a unified presence -  their approach isn't too rigid or dictatorial in tone or structure.

<em>Conclusions: Village Underground is not such a large arts centre but a unified presence still needs to be maintained across all third party sites. I also discussed tone on these different sites, Maryam said (around 16 minutes) there is not really a discernable difference in register anymore. However, the main website draws from press releases so there's slight difference in style. The Barbican's tone across other social media is fairly ""rough and ready"". In Village Underground's case I don't think there needs to be a register change.</em>

<strong>Facebook</strong>
Myspace is no longer really used by The Barbican and now their <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/BarbicanCentre"">Facebook site</a> is their social media hub. Maryam talked about the importance of reacting to the community and answering any questions they had claiming ""If you don't react you lose your audience."" She also mentioned posing questions or running small competition helped people interact with the site and gave them a reason for visiting. She also talked about the importance of not bombarding the audience via the Facebook mailing list.

<em>Conclusions: Although Village underground has a <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/London-United-Kingdom/Village-Underground/31887651414"">Facebook group site</a> it's not very well maintained, comparing it to Barbican's Facebook in conjunction with these tips will really help keep an audience on the Facebook site interested and engaged.</em>

<strong>Twitter</strong>
Barbican have only had a <a href=""http://twitter.com/barbicancentre"">presence here</a> for the last 6 months or so but already it has proved successful. According to their analytics they rank in the top 30 arts organisations in the world (6:30 minutes in). The tone on Twitter is even more informal and the conversational currency is fun. They have also played around with the form, recently conducting a successful Q&amp;A with a renowned violinist Sara Chang. They capitalised on this event by taking photos and putting it on the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/barbican/tags/livesarahchangqatwitter/"">Flickr site.</a>.

<em>Conclusions: Twitter needs to be set up and taken seriously, we chatted about it being a potential drain on resources. Maryam keeps this in check and only really responds to Tweets for an hour in the morning and afternoon. This is encouraging as there were concerns raised at the Skype meeting that Twitter would take up too much time.</em>

<strong>Last FM</strong>
Interestingly someone outside of the Barbican staff started a <a href=""http://www.last.fm/user/BarbicanMusic"">Last FM</a> presence and still maintains the site, updating the playlists, radio and events. According to their Google Analytics Last FM is one of their most successful sites for converting into ticket sales.

<em>Conclusions: I hadn't even thought of using Last FM. It makes even more sense to compile a playlist and presence for Village Underground as it stages quite a lot of music events. It might also be good to get favourite tracks they think represent Village Underground, or even ones that they play whilst working in the office and studio.</em>

<strong>YouTube</strong>
Their<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/barbicanlondon"">Barbican Channel</a> has gained an incredible amount of recognition due to video footage of their most recent installation by Celeste Boursier featuring bullfinches roosting on a guitar and amp. Although the footage was shot somewhere else and had previously had 2,000 hits, it was re-editted by Barbican staff and succeeded on their channel, receiving over 600,000 views.

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89Kz8Nxb-Bg]

Also interestingly the PR team put YouTube links in their press releases and this also created the buzz around this video. They have also just started a <a href=""http://vimeo.com/barbicancentre"">Vimeo account</a>, the content is the same as YouTube but Vimeo is preferred by designers. This preference was also expressed by the Village Underground designer at the last Skype meeting. Maryam is currently looking at Tube Mogul, a service that automatically puts the same content across different third party video sites. At the moment this is a paid for service.

<em>Conclusions: Village Underground needs a Channel, there is plenty of material floating around YouTube but if it is brought into a channel it makes it easier to use and monitor. Video needs also needs to be be promoted creatively, once you point the public or press to the site the video speaks for itself. Maryam also mentioned she wanted to encourage more of a ""rough and ready"" approach to video. It's all very well having polished bits of video but the public want to also see exclusives, voxpops and behind the scenes action. These can all be readily done with Village Underground.</em>

<strong>Flickr</strong>
Barbican have a broad array of press shots, amateur snaps and even flip footage on their Flickr site. Much of Maryam's work is concerned with encouraging people to tag them up properly. Correctly tagged, the images will also show up on the Barbican site's Flickr gallery, the Facebook Flickr widget and Twitpics. Maryam talked about how Flickr is helping to bring all three main sites together.

<em>Conclusions: Pretty much the same as YouTube conclusions, there are pics out there they just need pulling together.</em>

<strong>Blogging</strong>
There was some talk about encouraging blogs for certain projects but it very much depends on personality. I raised the point about what I'd noticed with the <a href=""http://www.liverpoolphil.com/337/vasily-petrenko/vasilys-blog.html"">Liverpool Philharmonic blog</a>, successful because the Chief Conductor Vasily Petrenko is charismatic with devoted fans. Maryam mentioned that person who blogs must be used to doing it, you can't force people to blog.

<em>Conclusions: no progression from the notes I made under 'Text' in my <a href=""http://productionlab.posterous.com/going-deeper-village-underground-1"">first stage research.</a></em>

<strong>Podcasts</strong>
Only a few podcasts have been produced so far but they have already gained recognition. The Barbican team have been told by iTunes that they might be mentioned in next month's Store Picks section. Obviously, the focus is mainly on music but Maryam would like to start producing podcasts for other departments, particularly theatre and maybe even visual arts (discussion!)

<em>Conclusions: Podcasts might be too time consuming for the limited time that I am able to help Village Underground. However, given the right training they are fairly easy to produce, maybe this is an element that can be introduced if an internship were to happen. I could quite easily train someone to produce decent audio.</em>

<strong>All In The Analysis</strong>
Maryam has many success stories to tell about her approach to online. Most importantly though, Google Analytics are key to measuring and proving that success to others. I need to chat to Jowan the web designer about what analytics are in place and to strengthen and consolidate them. What is clear is that there are quite a few social media bits already started by both the Village Underground and members of the public. Plenty of archive material already exists. For my project I need to organise these parts and create a strategy for going forward.","Celeste Boursier, Flickr, Last FM, MA Online Journalism, MA Online Journalism, Maryam Ashgari, MySpace Inc., Production Labs, Sara Chang, Skype, Social Media, Technology/Internet, The Barbican, Twitter, Village Underground, Village Underground, Web 2.0",
To Vimeo Or Not To Vimeo,"Sun, 21 Mar 2010 01:40:25 +0000",dandavies23,"For my first Multimedia Assignment I'm experimenting with video. But even putting out short chunked segments takes a while to edit, and even longer to upload. In my Production Lab work there's been a lot of discussion about which platform is better, Vimeo or YouTube. Certainly from a time perspective, YouTube is much quicker to upload. It took me a few hours to get three three-minute clips up last night. With Vimeo I had to leave the first clip overnight, the second took two hours this morning to upload, and I've given up on the third after it kept on dropping out. 

The thing is I know Vimeo is generally considered the better platform, especially for aesthetically sensitive designers but it appears my allocation only allows me to upload on HD package a week. And besides YouTube now offers unlimited HD. For standard Vimeo there's a cap at 500Mb. Here's the two clips together, see if you can <em>really </em>spot the difference. For extra fun play them together.

Home Of Metal audio and mapping,"Tue, 23 Mar 2010 16:07:16 +0000",dandavies23,"I'm fascinated by the capabilities of Geolocation so I decided as part of my multimedia portfolio I'd play around with some audio which was recorded on a Home Of Metal tour, hosted by Chris Phipps in March 2009.

<!--more-->

Once I'd re-located the sites and venues using my own memory of the walk (with a little help from <a href=""http://www.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100285685412338791851.0004667d594e03f9f288a&amp;ll=52.481108,-1.895142&amp;spn=0.146364,0.205994&amp;z=11&amp;source=embed"">Birmingham Music Map)</a> and Chris Phipps himself, I firstly geolocated everything in <a href=""http://audioboo.fm/dandavies23"">Audioboo</a> then inserted the information on my own map.

<iframe width=""425"" height=""350"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" src=""http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=110790423294616759808.000481e86f28904b8ac4e&amp;ll=52.477514,-1.900817&amp;spn=0.004503,0.00574&amp;output=embed""></iframe><br /><small>View <a href=""http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=110790423294616759808.000481e86f28904b8ac4e&amp;ll=52.477514,-1.900817&amp;spn=0.004503,0.00574&amp;source=embed"" style=""color:#0000FF;text-align:left"">Home Of Metal Birmingham Tour</a> in a larger map</small>

My original plan was to embed audio onto the pinpoints, but currently Google Maps doesn't allow you to use any kind of audio player. The nearest I could achieve was to embed a YouTube slide-show into my map - click on the Town Hall pinpoint at the top of the map as an example. As I mentioned in my last post, my main objections to YouTube are its clumsiness and untidiness, <del datetime=""2011-03-08T11:51:14+00:00"">it would be better if you could resize the slideshow and view it like this</del>:

[youtube width=""200"" height=""161""]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqmURoHVmFE[/youtube]

A site called <a href=""http://woices.com/walk/222"">Woices</a> uses Google Maps API to embed a walk. So far the site pretty much does what I can do below, with a touch of <a href=""http://woices.com/dandavies23"">Social Media</a> added.

More interesting is the Infospot which allows you to customise the site and access to analytics. In addition to the normal download option it can be triggered by Geolocation for iPhone users. I've been playing around with a trial version which isn't viewable to the public.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/woicesinfospot.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-343"" title=""woicesinfospot"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/woicesinfospot-300x255.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""255"" /></a>

To make this customised site viewable it would cost 59 Euros a month! This would be great if I had funding for this project and there was some kind of revenue model. A more cost effective way of producing this would be to set up a map in Flash, research Geolocation and maybe build a phone application myself.

If this was to be a more permanent serious tour project, I would also need to pay Chris Phipps for the use of his material. And even ask him (and others) to talk about other venues and their experiences of Birmingham's musical past.  I would also need to consider how the newly relaunched <a href=""http://www.homeofmetal.com/""> Home Of Metal site</a> is developing. Home Of Metal is after all a place where non-professional Heavy Metal fans can share their own experiences, memories and stories.

Finally, I need to consider how far this has moved from being a journalism project. News sites often geolocate stories and many online news projects can act as archives to preserve the past. But is recording the past, and creating and maintaining tours the responsibility of the journalist, a civic society or a historian?

<strong>STOP THE PRESS... <a href=""http://justblogging.co.uk"">@hadleypaul</a>  just alerted me to this beauty by @buddhamagnet </strong>

Te great thing about this is that it finds the boos by tags, so if I were to add more venues to Audioboo and tag them 'Home Of Metal' they would also pop up here!

Finally, I've created a full podcast with musical interludes to give you time to walk between pinpoints.

Why stay on the 'side?,"Wed, 24 Mar 2010 18:04:45 +0000",dandavies23,"<em>Putting the Created In Birmingham shop in the Bullring in the centre of Birmingham means that we're proud of our art.</em>

A bug bear I have about Birmingham is creativity occurs on the fringes of the city, and often this can make us appear self deprecating.  It's almost as if were embarrassed by our artists so we push them to the outskirts. Don't get me wrong, I'm behind the redefined Eastside. In fact I wrote the brochure's <a href=""http://www.weareeastside.com/who-are-eastside/"">main copy</a>. But where I struggled was working out how to make art accessible and appealing in description, without appearing to trivialise or belittle 'the art.' A picture paints a thousand words, I just wanted people to visit Eastside and make up their own minds. Hopefully, many will <a href=""http://www.weareeastside.com/2010/03/vivid-we-are-eastside-open-weekend/"">this weekend.</a>

The great thing about CiB shop's centrality is that people can check it out, with very little effort. If this shop was based in Digbeth, for example, they wouldn't have a fraction of the footfall. Take a look at this large and diverse mix of people in this 30 minute sample (recorded by me at 11am on a Thursday).

Okay, <a href=""http://cibshop.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/were-looking-for-art-to-sell/"">Pete Ashton in particular</a> acknowledges  it's ""in a shopping centre"" so there are a few pieces that might be too leftfield for this consumer-centric audience. But its strong centre-stage presence is great exposure for all artists adorning the walls and shelves. And intrinsically Created In Birmingham features independent artists creating original pieces. 

Besides wouldn't it be great if when the City Of Culture judges get off the train and the first place they pop into is this shop?","Birmingham, Bullring, Chris Unitt, CiBshop, Created In Birmingham, Digbeth, Digital media, Eastside, Multimedia, Pete Ashton, Vimeo",

Village Underground’s Social Life,"Sun, 18 Apr 2010 14:05:48 +0000",dandavies23,"Following a <a href=""http://productionlab.posterous.com/meeting-with-auro-foxcroft-and-new-intern-cle"">meeting with Auro and Clément</a> at the beginning of April, I managed to sort some dates to come down and cover activities at <a href=""http://www.villageunderground.co.uk/"">Village Underground.</a> Before I came down it was important to have some social media networks more sorted.

Village Underground now has a <a href=""http://twitter.com/villunderlondon"">Twitter Account</a>, a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/villunderlondon""> YouTube channel</a>, and a <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/villageunderground""> Flickr site.</a> I’ve also been overhauling their <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/London-United-Kingdom/Village-Underground/31887651414?ref=ts"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/villageunderground""> Myspace</a> presence. At the simplest level this has meant using all the logos and backgrounds so branding is carried across all elements. It also means effectively pulling content from elsewhere and thinking about re-distribution.

<!--more-->

<strong>Raw Material</strong>
You may have noticed from my last post on <a href=""http://productionlab.posterous.com/meeting-with-auro-foxcroft-and-new-intern-cle"">Posterous</a> that I had more plans for extra platforms. However, after I met with <a href=""http://www.raw-material.co.uk"">Raw Material</a> I decided that this isn’t the best solution.

Raw Material will be responsible for adding content across these sites after I’ve finished and they weren’t interested in unnecessarily complicating the brand. Because I was pulling all the current channels over a hectic weekend prior to my VU residency, I did perhaps hastily name some of these sites. For example Village Underground’s Twitter identity may get changed due to ‘VillUnderLondon’ not showing up in search results. The small following built purely through re-enlivening Facebook and following Twitter mentions was also balked at and doubtless audience figures will rapidly increase in the professional hands of Raw Material. I hope it will be better than this Insight screen grab of previous Facebook Group activity.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Facebook-analytics-11Apr.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-379"" title=""Facebook analytics 11Apr"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Facebook-analytics-11Apr-300x283.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""283"" /></a>

They also particularly questioned the need to have a real presence on audio sharing platforms such as Audioboo or even Sound Cloud. Auro wanted to put mixes of club nights online but Firgas from Raw Material mentioned PRS “would be all over it.” Firgas also doubted there would be much interest in detailed musical playlists or podcasts as VU’s music doesn’t have a particular sound. Instead of creating Spotify or Last FM playlists, I added a playlist of forthcoming acts to Myspace.

We also chatted about using video clips of live performance. We decided the best decision here was to take down if asked. Any full length interviews and performances that take place in one of the Village Underground driver cabs will need a separate release form. I will post separately about this material or you’ll probably see content pop up on all the channels mentioned.","Entertainment/Culture, Facebook Group, Facebook Inc, Firgas Las Palmas, Last FM, MA Online Journalism, MySpace, MySpace Inc., Online social networking, Posterous, Production Labs, Raw Material, Social Media, Social Media, Spotify, Technology/Internet, Twitter Inc, Village Underground, Village Underground, Web 2.0, YouTube Inc",
Village Underground Residency,"Sun, 18 Apr 2010 16:54:39 +0000",dandavies23,"As mentioned in <a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/tag/village-underground/"">previous blogs</a> I've been doing a consultancy placement at <a href=""http://www.villageunderground.co.uk/"">Village Underground.</a> I spent Monday and Tuesday in residence and two very different events were covered. On Monday we had a gig featuring TV On The Radio’s Kyp Malone Rain Machine project, with Marques Toliver in support. On Tuesday I was able to catch the ‘get in’ for Collaborative Dance Experience’s debut production Out Of Time.

I took with me 2 Kodak Zi8s and a Flip, my Dictaphone and an SLR camera. I was very happy with the material I shot. My first catch was Marques Toliver performing In The Cab. We were able to grab him between soundchecks and take him to the drivers cab of one of the tube trains on the roof. After his interview he performed an exclusive song. I shot this on all three cameras but put a quick rush on YouTube.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xJxgFuL2SQ

<!--more-->

This was in the hope that it would upload before the gig and maybe encourage people to come. However, it was shot in HD and cutting, rendering and uploading the clip took from around 5:30pm to 10:30pm. People were able to look at it after the gig and next day though, especially when Marques posted the video to <a href=""http://marques-toliver.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-for-village-underground.html""> his site.</a> At last count this had 124 views. It’s worth noting with the free Vimeo account I couldn’t even upload the full Marques Toliver interview and instead I just broadcast the song.

http://www.vimeo.com/10924543

It makes me wonder how much extra value there is in uploading a cut between 3 cameras a strong piece can stand alone? I also interviewed Kyp Malone - but this needs more editing, another lengthy process. It’s taken me 4 hours to convert the two Kodak files to MP4 and now I’m sitting waiting for it to load into Sony Vegas. (started 16:20, an hour later just 5% into material)

I spent the following day uploading my favourite Kyp Malone excerpts onto YouTube and with the help of a dedicated fan I was also able to rename them.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8cJL6lGT3o

I’m in a dilemma about using video. Inevitably it is much better quality in HD, compare the clip above with the Flip clip below for example.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w4a4TnFLjk

It does take considerably longer to put the HD stuff edited and online. The best practice might be to work out what can be uploaded instantly and do the more time draining stuff later on. When I put the Kyp Malone interview online, I'll aim for as professional level as possible, and include idents and credits.

Next time I want to concentrate on chunking the material whilst I record it and spend more time thinking about processing the clips as I'm recording them. In future I will shoot 2-3 minute chunks and try to start or finish on the musical bar!

Tuesday was spent mainly filtering, editing and uploading Kyp Malone material and resizing and uploading pictures to <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/villageunderground"">Flickr</a>. I was also able to grab an audio interview with Rosie Thomas from Collaborative Dance Experience. There wasn’t an awful lot to photograph at the ‘get in’ so instead Rosie gave me performance and production shots, which I quickly made into a 3 minute slide show. This was then published on YouTube and the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/London-United-Kingdom/Village-Underground/31887651414"">Facebook fan site</a> in time for their performance and maybe drive interest and audience.

Next time, I’d make the compilation of the slideshow a priority. This is simply because a slide show is the quickest way of publishing mixed media online, especially in upload terms.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Overall, I had an enjoyable few days experimentation which included a lot of variety. Having first hand experience of life working at Village Underground was the best way to explore and utilise the in house resources.

It’s fair to say that I did most of the work solo. I was concentrating on experimenting myself and didn't want to lead, although I was grateful for help from my sister in law. Next time I will have a clearer idea and better contingency plan in place for speeding up the process, using people from VU and providing good content quickly.

Starting Spaghetti Junctions,"Fri, 21 May 2010 14:43:42 +0000",dandavies23,"&nbsp;

Since last semester I’ve been <a href=""http://dandavies23.com/2010/02/the-final-stretch/"">thinking about</a> designing a game called Spaghetti Junctions.

Following a few experiments in other areas, including trying to wrangle with Ruby On Rails, I’ve finally bitten the bullet and attempted to get a prototype running on Wordpress.

I’ve adapted the platform for my needs, without much technical knowledge. Credit for using Wordpress must be given to <a href=""http://www.jonbounds.co.uk"">Jon Bounds</a> who suggested the idea. I had been concerned that I might be giving away too much by letting people ‘behind the scenes’ but I didn’t realise how much control I could have over what I can display and what options are available to users.

I’ve installed various plugins which have allowed me to enhance the experience. Firstly I’ve put Ultimate Google Analytics in place so that the back end doesn’t get bogged down in the built in stats. Secondly, I’ve installed a <a href=""http://andrewferguson.net/wordpress-plugins/countdown-timer/"">Countdown Timer</a> so that I can create round times and therefore maintain interest through levelling (for the purposes of this test period this isn’t set). And I’ve installed <a href=""http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-english/"">WP-Tables Reloaded</a> to create a scoreboard.

<a href=""http://www.spaghettijunctions.com""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-407 size-full"" title=""spaghettijuncscreen"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/spaghettijuncscreen.jpg"" alt="""" width=""965"" height=""605"" /></a>

At the moment this score board is a manually updated CSV, Excel sheet with the calculation boxes deselected. It’s uploaded but I don’t think it will take too much trouble to make this more ‘live’ by running this through a more automated Google Doc. At the moment I’m having some issues with it being able to correctly parse this data. If anyone has some tips it’d be much appreciated.

<del datetime=""2010-05-30T12:05:07+00:00"">I’ve also tried a lot of mapping plugins. The easiest for users to use in a post is <a href=""http://www.wpgeo.com/"">WP-Geo</a> however although I can activate polylines I want to be able to use them to display specific Spaghetti Junctions. This is one of the main points of the game. I’ve got a feeling I might need to delve into JQuery. One alternative solution I thought of was exporting the everything into my own Google Map and then manually adding. Is this possible?</del>

I'm now using a very versatile plugin called <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/"">Geo Mashup</a> which allows me to add polylines it by marking it in the categories. I can also download the KML. However it still fairly manual.

""Manual"" is a keyword here. And this is my main obstacle to overcome if I was to make this in anyway scalable. If there was some way of automating the review process so that the facts or myths could be approved via rating might be some solution to having an all seeing ‘Chinnmaster’. Also I need to work out a way of further automating the score process. I suspect the answer might lie in Ruby On Rails. At least I've made a start!

So <a href=""http://www.spaghettijunctions.com"">here is Spaghetti Junctions</a>. Please play it and let me know what you think so far.","experimental journalism, Google Maps, Jon Bounds, journalism games, MA Online Journalism, multumedia, Ruby On Rails, WordPress",
Making Our Presence Known #intheroom,"Thu, 17 Jun 2010 14:48:59 +0000",dandavies23,"According to Paul Murphy from <a href=""http://thedestroyers.co.uk/"">The Destroyers</a> one of the reasons why we missed out on the European Capital Of Culture award was that when the judges visited the city no-one on the ground cared about either the award or the cultural ongoings.

The traditional perception with Birmingham is that we do plenty of creative and cultural things but we don't like to shout about it. Cllr Martin Mullaney has pointed out several times during this City Of Culture bid that as a city we have very low levels of cultural engagement per head of population. I was determined in my role as Social Media Manager to increase engagement and prove that, given the right platform, we would shout about it.

My first day on the job involved working on the <a href=""http://blog.birminghamculture.org/"">24hour Blog</a> run by Jon Bounds. We received a phenomenal amount of contribution to the Posterous site in a 24 hour period. Since then our engagement was spread across <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/BirminghamCulture"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/bhamculture2013"">Twitter</a> and the <a href=""http://www.birminghamculture.org"">main website</a>.

When monitoring other shortlisted cities social media activities it was interesting to discover their bids were mainly limited to Facebook. We on the other hand had a much larger amount of Twitter followers. Today it passed the 1000 mark.

Only eight people were allowed to present the Birmingham's case to the judging panel in Liverpool, we wanted to increase our presence. Birmingham had plans to take a Battle Bus which would stage cultural flashmobs around Liverpool on the day.

Public Relations Manager Geoff Coleman mentioned doing something similar to 24hour blog and I pitched the idea of using Cover It Live as a scrolling commentary which could be displayed <a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/2010/06/birmingham-in-the-room-2/"">'in the room'</a>. It was important to gather all the different threads across multiple platforms. I also thought it was an ideal opportunity to make a virtual event out of our final submission. I passionately stated at the time,

""Can I just say that Birmingham's strength as a digital city is one of our greatest assets and it would be doing ourselves a great disservice not to do something really innovative.""

I'm pleased to say that it was a success, there were around 900 messages of support over the period, and the Council Site where Cover It Live was embedded reported a spike of over 1000 unique users.

@Katchoo has <a href=""http://bit.ly/c0QzHU"">blogged</a> about what it was like to be involved in the event. A point well made was that it wasn't just the usual people mentioning the same things. The real success of the event came from the variety of comments, the amount of people involved and the many cultural things Birmingham offers. We're a culturally rich city that deserves recognition. And for once we really shouted about it.","Birmingham City of Culture, Culture, Facebook, Jon Bounds, Martin Mullaney, Paul Murphy, Posterous, Social Media, Twitter",
Proving Ourselves In A Field – Mashed Festivals At Shambala,"Sun, 05 Sep 2010 14:42:57 +0000",dandavies23,"Since October last year I’ve been researching and developing my idea of bringing Mobile Journalism to Music Festivals. As festival season kicked off the <a href=""http://mashedfestivals.com"">website</a> started to take shape. With help from <a href=""http://carolinebeavon.com"">Caroline Beavon</a>, a few early experiments in uploading and curating content took place at Glastonbury, Sudoeste in Portugal and Off The Cuff in Birmingham but the main target was a full blown operation at <a href=""http://shambalafestival.org"">Shambala Festival</a> which took place on August Bank Holiday weekend 2010.

<a href=""http://mashedfestivals.com""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-451"" title=""Header beta"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Header-beta.jpg"" alt="""" width=""249"" height=""116"" /></a>

I’ve spent a lot of time developing the site and defining the brand over the summer, it’s still very much in development. In fact, one of the main advantages of working with Shambala was that they were open to new ideas and willing to help us develop, but naturally there was a degree of reciprocation with this relationship.

Shambala suggested Mashed Festivals (MF) offered media training to teenagers and taught them how to produce online content using mobile techniques. I wasn’t too keen to do this in the beginning as I wanted content on the MF site to be professionally captured from a team of journalists with different expertise. The best stuff for the site would be produced by my core team which would set the bench mark for the quality of the user generated content (UGC) - I was concerned the teenage training element would devalue this.

I couldn’t have been more wrong. With the cooperation of Shambala we sent out an invitation to all teen ticket members and cherry picked a small team of six girls and boys who were enthusiastic and talented to boot who became the MF Press Gang. Their final output which comprised 40 stories on the <a href=""http://mashedfestivals.com/shambala"">mobile optimised microsite</a> is of such a high standard that I’m now moving away from the idea of curating unfocussed UGC altogether.

<a href=""http://mashedfestivals.com/shambala""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-454"" title=""mfbanner"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/mfbanner-300x59.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""59"" /></a>

I still kept my professional core team who had a breadth of experience but were able to specialise and train in certain areas. I offered advice and assistance in photography, <a href=""http://julietspare.wordpress.com/"">Juliet Spare</a> advised on audio and Jon Kennard’s expertise lie in film and video. Caroline Beavon was in control of the process of collation and uploading.

Jon Kennard details his experience training for video with Hannah Lepper and Kyle Douglas <a href=""http://www.trainingzone.co.uk/blogs/jon-kennard/acting-editor039s-blog/was-weekend-was"">here.</a>

Both Iona Berry and Holly Game were studying photography at college. Iona brought her own camera and was pretty self-sufficient. We provided Holly with a camera and she needed a little more encouragement and guidance. I offered advice on what looked good online and stressed the importance of speed rather than spending days filtering and treating photos.

None of the teenagers had any experience in audio but wanted to learn so Juliet trained two members of the press gang. Josephine Gilbert learnt very quickly delivering perceptive interviews.

Some of the best material came when the gang teamed up to combine skills. My favourite examples being the slideshows. Which included contributions from all the group.

My favourite experience was taking the Press Gang backstage for the first time, showing them how to gain access, secure interviews and find the person in charge! This resulted in a wealth of material and a superb interview.

I was very pleased the Press Gang didn’t just stick to one skill.

In and Out of Inside Out,"Mon, 08 Nov 2010 16:16:36 +0000",dandavies23,"On Monday <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vz69b"">Inside Out West Midlands broadcast </a>their report on cycling around Birmingham which featured talking about my <a href=""http://www.bhamcycledata.com"">Birmingham Cycle Data</a> site but also getting on my bike and checking out facilities for cyclists around the city. This road footage was inspired by my <a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/2010/01/bike-further-from-kerb/"">previous excursions</a> with a Flip.

The BBC filming was an invaluable experience but for me it highlighted the difference between how you can allow a story to develop online compared with needing to have elements pre-defined when you start filming. My challenge for Inside Out was based around a FOI request and inquiry with City Council’s press office as to the amount of cycling improvements that had been made in the last few years. I then hit the road to see how the improvements had been installed.

Obviously, filming time is precious and to have a crew follow me round each improvement would have been expensive. The Inside Out package is about the state of cycling in the city, so just me peddling on my bike would be wouldn't have answered the general question 'Is Birmingham safe for cyclists?'. Instead this is a montage sequence with some on the spot conclusions at the end then plenty of context and 'right to reply' by the council.

I was pleased to see that my <a href=""http://www.bhamcycledata.com/2010/05/31/belgravemiddleway/"">Belgrave Middleway coverage</a> was used as a way to introduce but something my online footage allowed me to do was show the extent of the law breaking and to <a href=""http://www.bhamcycledata.com/2010/06/07/belgrave-middleway-graphs/"">back that up with stats.</a>

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTPC_SqtmlQ

Within the confines of the TV programme you get an impression of what happened but you don’t get an in depth investigation. Furthermore, the point of <a href=""http://www.bhamcycledata.com"">Birmingham Cycle Data</a> was to explore many cycle stories that affect Birmingham cyclists. It mainly using data visualisation to display how a question such as 'Is Birmingham safe for cyclists' is a complex one that <a href=""http://www.bhamcycledata.com/2010/06/05/accidenttreemap/"">can't have a simple answer.</a>

I’d love the opportunity to now take the council cycling improvements story to my website. Ideally I'd display them on a map to visualise the scale of what the council has installed and where. Maybe even gather footage and evidence of me and others tackling them. This in conjunction with the larger exposure of BBC 1 programme would build up a more detailed picture of cycling improvements in the city and make suggestions how they could be further improved.

For now though you’ll have to just put up with my talking ‘helmet hair’ head.","Birmingham, City Council, cycling, cycling",
Changing Tracks,"Thu, 10 Feb 2011 21:11:27 +0000",dandavies23,"This is the first time in three months that I have decided to blog. There are many reasons for this but one of the most important is a rapid life transition. This site was specifically set up to track my progress through my MA in Online Journalism. So for a while after I found that I had essentially blogged myself into a corner.

Things have also changed for me geographically too. The week I submitted my final dissertation, my wife and I loaded several vanloads and transported ourselves (and an obscene amount of CD’s) to Manchester.

Of course, the process of gaining employment has been slower. I made a conscious decision whilst I was studying that I would stick to freelance for a while, do enough of that to keep me in reasonable comfort and only go for staff jobs that I really want. My wife often reminds me that this is a somewhat privileged place to be in.

So, I’ve been trying to find my footing in the Digital Manchester community - attending Social Media Surgeries and Cafes which have evolved in quite a different way to the Birmingham versions. These differences I will certainly mention and discuss in later posts. In the last few weeks I have begun to start working with the good people of <a href=""http://insidethem60.journallocal.co.uk/"">Inside The M60</a>. My progress here will also be written about soon.

I have carried work up North with me. The Birmingham City of Culture Social Media work continues not least because we engaged a sizeable amount of people during the campaign and it would be a shame to ‘disengage’ them. The <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/BirminghamCulture"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/brumculture"">Twitter</a> still continue to promote and celebrate the cultural delights that the city has to offer – large and small.

I’ve also begun to preach a bit of what I’ve practiced with a Visiting Lecturer role at Birmingham City University helping first year BA students understand the basics of journalism. Most recently I have also started to teach MA Magazine Journalism students of City University London how to complement their final printed production with an online presence.

If I’m honest, the most interesting full time jobs still seem to be in London and if I do find the right job maybe we’ll pack up and migrate there. For the moment however any London work is achievable due to my sister-in-law and <a href=""http://www.villageunderground.co.uk/"">Village Underground</a> who have agreed to offer me a bed as long as I promise to occasionally “do something amazing” for them.

These current commutes have one definite advantage: long train journeys give me time to write. So at least once a week from now onwards I intend to reflect on what I’ve been doing.

Creating A Culture Calendar for Inside The M60,"Sat, 05 Mar 2011 14:25:33 +0000",dandavies23,"I’ve recently started working with <a href=""http://insidethem60.journallocal.co.uk/"">Inside The M60</a>. In addition to being on hand to help with little Wordpress tweaks, I’ve been trying to carve out a little niche for myself.

Obviously, I come from “down the M6” so my local knowledge isn’t great, but I do know my culture. The site editors Louise Bolotin and Nigel Barlow understood the advantages of having a listings section and so let me loose.

Inspired by the work of <a href=""http://wicci.org.uk/"">Wicci</a> which runs through Wordpress, I looked into suitable calendars. I’d previously encouraged Nigel and Louise to get their events into Google Calendar, so it made sense to at least base it there.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/blowback""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-492"" title=""googlecalendargrab"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/googlecalendargrab-300x125.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""125"" /></a>

After a few false starts I found <a href=""http://www.rhanney.co.uk/plugins/google-calendar-events/#download"">Google Calendar Events</a> developed by Ross Hanney. I’m really impressed with the strength of the widget particularly its flexibility and the attentive nature of Ross. It makes such a difference if there is decent support for a plugin.

Setting the plugin up was a bit fiddly. What I wanted to do was make the calendar link out to tickets or, where possible, to link back to previews or reviews on Inside The M60. This way the calendar aids site navigation. There’s a bit of a jiggle which you have to make to the PHP to make it read HTML in Google Calendar details but Ross intends to introduce this as a dashboard setting.

Once I’d got the plugin running on the <a href=""http://dandavies23.com/blowback"">back end of my site</a> I approached Philip John to get it installed on Journal Local, where Inside The M60 is based. Philip had some reservations about to cross-site scripting attacks again I consulted Ross and <a href=""http://www.rhanney.co.uk/plugins/google-calendar-events/comment-page-17/#comment-2838"">we introduced a bit of code</a> to stop this.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/blowback""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-508"" title=""calendar"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/calendar-300x230.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""230"" /></a>

Inside The M60 are really happy with the Calendar, it has increased traffic to the site and has added another dimension. It’s also helped me get a cultural handle on Manchester and makes me feel excited about basing myself here.

I would like to encourage more of a standard way of contributing and I’m considering following the example of Wicci and allowing promoters and people to add listings themselves. I’m also thinking about taking feeds from other site. But at the moment I feel we’ve got more quality control by doing it ourselves.

One of the MA Magazine groups from City University are doing a magazine for the East End of London and they wanted to bring in a map. I naturally recommended Google Calendar Events. This week they’re going live with it so keep an eye on <a href=""http://eastboundlondon.co.uk/"">Eastbound Magazine’s</a> website.","Content management systems, Louise Bolotin, Manchester, Nigel Barlow, Ross Hanney, WordPress",
From print publishing to mobile: Lessons learned from Condé Nast,"Wed, 27 Apr 2011 13:34:41 +0000",dandavies23,"When the iPad launched last year few magazine publishers were as prepared as Condé Nast. It leapt out of the blocks announcing plans for mobile incarnations of Wired, Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.

But all this could be about to change. Senior CN execs are stepping back efforts on iPad editions, following a less-than-impressive financial return from a signficant investment. Ad Age quotes an anonymous Condé Nast publisher who, while keen to point out this is not a reverse of ambition, admitted that creating iPad apps for all publications is no longer the goal.

“They’re not all doing all that well, <i>so why rush to get them all on there?</i>” they say.
<h3>So what can we learn from Condé Nast’s experiments?</h3>
Apps are fun but costs win out. <a href=""http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2010/10/conde_nast_shar.php"">Research</a> commissioned by Condé last October (via Tom Foremski), involving 100 hours of one-on-one interviews and 5,000 in-app surveys, found that readers commonly spent more time with the electronic version than the print equivalent. Condé concluded:

“Users responded positively to the additional functionality of the iPad. Therefore advertisers that included compelling and unique experiences, that were self-contained and exclusive to the environment, were liked more than those that did not.”

<b>But did they go far enough?</b> Dominic Jacquesson, author of TheMediaBriefing’s report <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/mobile-strategies"">Mobile Strategies for Media Owners</a>, told me today that Condé’s <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/201010/102510AdobeCondeNast.html"">decision to use Adobe’s Publishing Suite</a> to create its apps tied it too much to the print model.

Jacquesson says: “To their credit, they embraced the tablet opportunity early on and firmly. However, in partnering with Adobe, <b>it was clear that they were going to treat tablet apps as print replicas with bells and whistles thrown in</b> – both from an external audience perspective and in terms of internal production processes.”

Condé Nast has adapted to this situation. Special editions, such as location-specific Traveller apps or $0.99 Vogue exclusives have done well.
<h3>Cost And Subscription</h3>
Leaving aside Condé Nast’s free, mobile-specific applications such as the popular Epicurious, its magazine apps are highly priced. In the UK most editions in iTunes are priced around the £3 mark. Data from analysts at Distimo shows that only 45 percent of iPad apps were in this price bracket from January-December 2010.

It could be that the pricing is too close to newsstand price which doesn’t match up with the expectation of an audience that is used to free web content. However, the <a href=""http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/05/wired-ipad-app-sells-24000-copies-in-first-24-hours/"">launch edition</a> of Wired’s iPad app was $5 – the same as the US magazine cover price – which was welcomed by some overseas mag readers who were paying as much as $14 an issue.

“<b>They have kept their app prices too high per issue to entice either new readers</b> to have a peek, or existing readers to switch” says Dominic Jacquesson. “The resulting repeated droop in downloads between issues 1 and 2 for each title they app’ed is definitely a case of ‘I told you so,’ and I fear it will be at least another year before they significantly shift their mobile strategy to a more sustainable footing.”
<h3>An appy future ahead?</h3>
Despite those early trouble, Condé Nast and constantly re-evaluating their mobile strategy Condé Nast have left room to manoeuvre. For Jacquesson this has meant that it has possibly averted financial collapse.

“The upside for Condé Nast is that its print titles are amongst the best in the magazine sector, with a particular appeal in emerging markets worldwide, and the economic recovery has therefore benefited it earlier than most. So its fears back in 2009 of a structurally permanent advertising collapse have not come to pass…at least, not yet.”

And for the rest of us, we can learn from its mistakes before we implement them.

<i>We’ll be discussing all these issues at TheMediaBriefing’s next brilliant conference <b><a href=""http://mobilemedia.themediabriefing.com/"">Mobile Media Strategies</a></b> on June 14 in London. Early Bird tickets are available now.</i>

Interview: GMG Radio working on a ‘hybrid’ digital future for radio,"Wed, 22 Jun 2011 10:43:32 +0000",dandavies23,"The digital revolution raging through traditional media is accelerating and radio is no different: there are growing numbers of digital and internet listeners, meaning that the business model and consumption trends are changing fast. Yes, people mostly listen via AM/FM and the stations sell advertising (or get publicly funded via the BBC) but the next few years are crucial.

As James Cridland <a href=""http://james.cridland.net/blog/uk-radioplayer-releases-its-first-figures/"">points out</a>, the combined audience of the Radioplayer online radio platform in the UK is 5.7 unique users a month, with more than 22 million individual sessions, a bigger audience than ITV and Channel 4 combined.

And the possibilities are huge: according to RAJAR, radio listening reached its highest level <em>ever</em> recorded (91.6 percent of the UK population) in the first quarter of this year.

But the BBC still looms large with an audience including more than 55 percent of the UK adult population, making the job of commercial radio brands – facing the threat of platform shift <em>and</em> the BBC – a tough one indeed.

One man charged with understanding all that is James Rea, who was <a href=""http://www.radioworks.co.uk/news/newsStory.php?story=1238"">last month</a> appointed Guardian Media Group’s deputy group programme director. He still retains responsibility for for news output and special broadcasts, but with a lot more besides, including “developing new partnerships in the digital arena to extend the group’s content to new audiences,” according to the company.

According to figures from last October, <strong>one in four listeners of GMG stations (which comprises Rock, Real and Smooth radio) audience are <a href=""http://www.gmgradio.com/news/story/smooth-radio-tops-three-million-listeners/159"">tuning-in via a digital/online platform</a></strong>. I caught up with Rea to ask him what the plans are…

<!--more-->

<strong>TMB: How will GMG distribute its stations across different platforms in the months and years to come?</strong>

<strong>Rea</strong>: GMG’s radio brands are already available reaching new audiences across many platforms: on mobile, online, on DAB digital radio, digital TV and on FM. Our focus is on creating content and then finding the most relevant platforms to deliver it on. Radio listening is at an all-time high; people love it and it also works in increasingly converged digital world.

<strong>With digital media what has and hasn’t worked?</strong>

There’s nothing that hasn’t worked – we’ve gone into this in the spirit of experimentation and trying new things.

It’s been a very encouraging start for <a href=""http://www.radioplayer.co.uk/"">Radioplayer</a>. The first audience figures showed it had 5.7 million listeners in May. Radioplayer is a great example of how the industry – the BBC and commercial – can cooperate on technology which is crucial because our futures are locked together and we want to expand the overall listening audience.

We’re working with digital services like We7, not against them, and want to look at all the new technologies and how audiences are using them. We have music and entertainment radio brands which are loved and listened to by millions of people every week but the key to their success is the expert teams who understand the audience and build a listening experience that really connects. Digital solutions have a long way to go to deliver that heritage so there’s plenty we can bring to any partnerships.

<strong>In terms of digital expansion for GMG Radio – what’s on the horizon?</strong>

We think radio has a hybrid future – a coalition of many platforms and infinite choice. But it’s the quality of content that we should be obsessed about not the platform. We have human editors who know their audience and that is crucial. That level of understanding can’t always be delivered by a computer.

<strong>Do station audiences have a distinctive way that they use different platforms – what are the trends in usage?</strong>

Audiences are expecting more from radio brands and new digital listening platforms open up massive creative opportunities to connect with listeners. What’s clear is many listeners want more from radio – not just to listen – but to watch, share and feel much more involved. There are also others who don’t want interactivity so we need to deliver radio on many terms and different platforms allow that.

<strong>How is digital affecting the business, is there clear ROI or are you still experimenting?</strong>

Digital flows through everything we do. New listening platforms will grow overall listening hours, open up new content and fresh opportunities for advertisers.

Putting the business model first: Why making money should be the lifeblood of local,"Thu, 02 Jun 2011 11:05:31 +0000",dandavies23,"Digital revenue growth for news and information publishers is going in the right direction in the UK. But is it rising fast enough in regional news?
<h3>Thinking big but not acting locally</h3>
For example, Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT) is making serious money online from <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/"">Mail Online</a> – £8 million in the six months to April 3 – and pushed past the Huffington Post to become <a href=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/128613/mail-online-passes-huffington-post-for-2nd-largest-news-site/"">the world’s second largest news site</a> with 60 million unique visitors a month. But at the same time digital revenue from its regional Northcliffe division actually dipped two percent.

Guardian.co.uk has more than 50 million users but it stopped its <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2011/apr/27/guardian-local-update"">Guardian Local</a> experiment because it was commercially “unsustainable”. TheMediaBriefing’s contributor Ed Oldfield <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/2011-05-06/guardians-failed-experiment-in-local-news-starts-a-chain-reaction"">suggested</a> that the scheme may spark other local startups to follow in its wake, but they will need to avoid the same mistakes of failing to innovate enough commercially.

Self-serve ad managing tool Addiply generated only £500 for the three sites over the past year, although there were local advertising opportunities for Guardian Local, including its highly profitable Soulmates dating service and Google Adsense revenue, but not enough. (Read Addiply founder <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/2011-05-06/guardians-failed-experiment-in-local-news-starts-a-chain-reaction#comment-199221472"">Rick Waghorn’s comment</a> clarifying that £500 figure here)
<h3>Could a start-up prevail in local ads?</h3>
Are established newspaper publishers putting the content <em>first</em> and the business model <em>second</em> when it comes to online media?

This is where a smaller operator could make a big impact. <a href=""http://mediastreetapp.com/"">Media Street Apps</a>, which launched with <a href=""http://kingsroad.co.uk/"">Kingsroad.co.uk</a> in 2009, was founded by online marketer Jack Rutter and tech specialist Jonathan Lloyd. Their approach was to generate revenue first.

“We’ve started backwards,” says Lloyd “By that I mean <strong>we started with the local business owner first and then have added local news content last</strong>. I know that seems crazy but it’s enabled us to shape both the Media Street software and our products.”

Focusing on the London street which stretches from Chelsea to Fulham, King’s Road is a community site and carries local news like many other “hyperlocal” start-ups. By choosing a street renowned for clothing boutiques and other independent outlets there was a clear opportunity for person-to-person ad sales. Local businesses that advertise or are listed on the site range from the independent <a href=""http://kingsroad.co.uk/fifiwilson"">FiFi Wilson</a> boutique to the established <a href=""http://kingsroad.co.uk/krsc"">King’s Road Sporting Club</a>.

In May, King’s Road joined the <a href=""http://www.glammedia.com/"">Glam Media</a> network – the American digital female-focused ad network. Major brands such as Boots and Net-A-Porter have appeared on the website. However the buck doesn’t just stop at placement ads.

“Our business model is not just built on online advertising; we do video, online marketing, competitions and paid content. Hyperlocal sites should look at these other revenue streams too,” says Lloyd.
<h3>Marketing as a service</h3>
This is wider trend on small scale. Publishers are beginning to offer more than just simple advertising: trade publisher UBM is offering varied and interesting packages in B2B, and magazine publisher Condé Nast launching its Ideactive client services division, as my colleague Patrick Smith detailed <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/2011-05-25/sell-better-sell-differently-why-offering-client-services-is-crucial-to-digital-media"">here</a>.

Media Street also has plans to increase SEO for clients and online and affiliate revenues as well as paid events. This will be the first full financial year for the company but and it has a modest target of £60,000 revenues for its financial year end on December 31 2011.

By this time Lloyd hopes to transfer the Media Street model and software across several streets in London starting with <a href=""http://fulhamroad.co.uk"">Fulham Road</a>.

Herein lies a digital media business model for our times: keep the content local but the operating system universal.

Counting the cost and benefits of community managers,"Tue, 24 May 2011 11:14:08 +0000",dandavies23,"The role of community manager has gone from being a social experiment to an integral part of the newsroom. But are they there to teach old hacks new digital tricks or is there now a genuine business imperative and ROI factor in having staff to represent your brand through social media?
<h3>Which side are you on?</h3>
Kate Day, social media and engagement editor for Telegraph.co.uk, and is about to appoint a community manager, a new role for the title. Although Day admits she spends a lot of time in both marketing and editorial departments the new role will be closely linked to editorial.

She tells me: “We received a lot of applications from journalists, and also social media marketing people. This role is rooted in editorial so we are looking for someone who really understands the newsroom and it's likely that they will be a journalist. The role will involve helping journalists source and develop news stories by making the best use new tools and platforms as well as helping to build a loyal, engaged digital audience.”

As far as Day is concerned, this role is there to not only help journalists do more but also to recommend the best social tools and skills to others. They will be required to have an overview of the industry and what competitors are doing with socially online.

The Telegraph’s community manager will focus largely on Facebook and Twitter but also keep an eye on comments on the site and the <a href=""http://my.telegraph.co.uk//"">My Telegraph</a> blogging platform.
<h3>Making it count</h3>
Day claims that because the Telegraph’s audience is fragmented across external networks and its own website, it’s no longer possible to generate a <em>single</em> stat to measure success.

“We can measure referral traffic, the number people on Facebook and Twitter amount of time they spend on the site and so on,” says Day. “<strong>There’s no single number that represents engagement or revenue return very well</strong>.”

Justin Fogarty is online community manager for <a href=""http://ariba.com/about/""> Ariba</a> a spend management site. He oversees a customer community called <a href=""http://exchange.ariba.com"">Ariba Exchange</a> as well as managing several LinkedIn groups. He maintains that even from a B2B perspective the money is often difficult to trace, at least at first.

He <a href=""http://mashable.com/2011/05/17/branded-community-tips/"">writes on Mashable</a>: “It’s not about ROI or advertising dollars at the beginning. It’s not about messaging and positioning. Customers will come back to a place with a compelling reason for going there in the first place.

“Let the user determine the model, and look at the type of user that you want to attract as the primary driver behind the online presence.”

But surely some companies by now are reaching a point where we can begin to see the money?
<h3>Social monetisation manager?</h3>
Mashable’s community manager Vadim Lavrusik, who previously worked at the New York Times, says making money is the next logical step for news organisations. He <a href=""http://mashable.com/2011/02/03/social-media-manager-social-monetization-manager/"">cites</a> a job advert from <a href=""http://www.coxmediagroup.com/about/"">Cox Media Group</a>, which emphasises the revenue generation aspect of community management. Cox runs 15 broadcast television stations, 85 radio stations and eight daily newspapers. Interestingly, it already has a social media manager, Mathilde Picard, and this is an extra role – another example of how media groups create interaction <em>first</em> before moving to monetisation.

“In some ways, Cox is making a big bet that social media will play a big role in its revenue strategy — at least one big enough to require such a position,” says Lavrusik. “The position is part of a further shift in company strategy to invest in digital.”

The question is: are we ready to take this leap into a focus on not just <em>interaction</em> but <em>revenue</em> in the UK? Social media is about conversation, not pound signs, and brands risk losing credibility by seemingly selling out to advertising and harsh marketing messages.

Saatchi mobile marketer: Mobile web is better value than apps,"Tue, 24 May 2011 11:17:54 +0000",dandavies23,"We all know that mobile is a rapidly evolving marketplace packed with plenty of sleek shiny gizmos – but it’s all too easy to be dazzled by the newest toy and forget the basics. <a href=""http://www.insidemob.com/about-bio1.html"">James Hilton</a>, joint managing director of M&amp;C Saatchi Mobile, says commercial success comes from creative and effective communication – and you don’t <em>need</em> an app to get it.

Just five years ago when the company was founded as the independent agency Inside Mobile, mobile content was a tricky terrain. Phone apps were created in Java and required individual builds which, even after a considerable investment, wouldn’t necessarily run on all handsets.
<h3>The irresistible rise of the smartphone</h3>
But now smartphones have revolutionised how and when we interact with the web and online-enabled apps. Hilton believes a major shift in perception came from the stability that the Apple store and the iPhone platform provided.

But development costs are high. In order to get a successful uptake there needs to be considerable investment and bug testing. When the app is launched it needs to be closely monitored and promoted carefully to be picked up in the Apple Store or Android Market.

Nevertheless if he had £10,000 to spend on a campaign, <strong>he’d opt for a mobile site rather than an app</strong>:

“This makes it agnostic of all technology so all users are open to the opportunity. If you are designing for mobile internet then the content needs to be a lot shorter and more snackable.”
<h3>The bad old days</h3>
Illustrating what can be done without apps – and that people have been doing this stuff intelligently for years – Hilton mentions one of Inside Mobile’s most award-winning campaigns was for Reebok, built around the 2008 NBA basketball playoff final. The campaign combined branded SMS and ringtones while greater context and exclusive content was carried by voice messages and a WAP-enabled microsite.

See it for yourself:

<h3>Resistance to viral</h3>
Whilst certain things stay the same there is no longer a secret formula for making digital or mobile content go viral. In fact it’s much more difficult to do this now given the number of agencies specifically <em>trying</em> to make their product take off on forums YouTube….

“In 2000 almost everything on the internet was viral. Now we find that our audience has matured and become more sophisticated. We can still provide the touchpoints for viral – allowing sharing of something using social media – but it’s difficult to predict what will work.”

Apps are currently leading the mobile media debate but perhaps this won’t always remain this way – according to Hilton, something very close to <em>all</em> phones around today can access the internet. He anticipates that because of increasing deployment of Google’s Android operating system, there will be some innovative use of HTML 5 on the horizon – and the boundaries between apps and the web will start to blur.

“We’re finding the lines between mobile and digital is blurring. Companies such as M&amp;C Saatchi appreciated that their clients want to move smoothly between different platforms. Mobile is now integrated and at the heart of the business.”

Can paywalls be sociable? David Cushman on social media in news publishing,"Wed, 04 May 2011 11:38:42 +0000",dandavies23,"Adopting a successful social media strategy doesn’t just mean getting yourself a Facebook page or Twitter profile. Social media is no longer an add-on – it must be at the centre of your business, according to one leading digital interaction expert.

<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcushman"">David Cushman</a>, MD of the <a href=""http://ninety10group.com/"">90:10 Group</a>, who blogs at <a href=""http://fasterfuture.blogspot.com/"">Fasterfuture.blogspot.com</a>, told me in a video interview that the biggest mistake publishers can make in this area is adopting a heavy handed “top down” approach. “<strong>It is not a channel, it is not a way in which you distribute content</strong> … it has to be at the heart of what you do,” he says.
<h3>Audit first</h3>
Cushman’s mantra is to <strong>listen</strong> to both your organisation and your audience and keep an open mind. “You have to let your audience inform what you do. Only then will they <em>interested</em> in passing it around,” he says.
<h3>Paywalls hinder sharing</h3>
Few would deny this stuff is important. But what if your business model isn’t compatible with social sharing? Erecting a paywall, for example, around your content hinders exposure and the building of interpersonal networks. Cushman acknowledges specialist information, delivered well, can lead to a successful paywall model but <em>closed</em> is still not good enough.

The New York Times realised this and sidestepped the paywall model – NYTimes.com readers can view articles discovered through social media, even if you’ve passed your monthly limit. But as <a href=""http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/2011-03-21/new-york-times-experiments-with-perverse-incentives"">we’ve mentioned</a> this approach undermines the paywall entirely.

Almost a quarter of a million people now digitally subscribe to The Financial Times, an increase of 8.1 percent since January 2011. But Cushman is cautious:

“Even they haven’t got it right for me, because they’re not doing it <em>for</em> me. It’s not focused enough and it’s not social.”
<h3>Who’s really open?</h3>
The Guardian’s <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2011/apr/28/the-guardian-blogging""> call to media and technology bloggers</a> proudly declares that it is an open platform. But as Cushman points out “the only truly open silo is the internet.”

Cushman (who spoke to the Guardian <a href=""http://fasterfuture.blogspot.com/2011/04/what-makes-you-share.html"">recently</a>) thinks this attitude will encourage people who identify with the brand to contribute. Fundamentally, there has to be some incentive for the blogger to move onto the website. “The people who chose to go on their platform do so with a mission in mind”

Thankfully this was not an issue at Womad, which was down to the excellent site wide public WiFi provided by <a href=""http://www.etherlive.co.uk/"">Etherlive</a>. I spoke to the MD Chris Green and he told me in total they shifted 1TB (terabyte) of internet traffic this weekend - which I got really excited about, my wife didn't.

<strong>Kit and Tech</strong>
Last year I had an Android HTC Tattoo, Flips, dictaphones, SLRs and a Flash mic. 2011, I had an iPhone 4. My dependency on additional bits of tech to give comprehensive multimedia coverage was less needed. It also meant that I approached it differently. Video was shot and uploaded directly to YouTube from my phone and photos were initially shared on Instagram first. I still had my SLR but Instagram tended to be my first port of call. I would like to find a web app that makes it more useable and interactive online - not least an app that allows search and the opportunity to search for tagged photos and install slideshows. Further investigation is needed into the Instagram Realtime API and <a href=""http://hatchcraft.com/2011/04/20/top-5-instagram-web-interfaces/"">these interfaces</a>. At Womad Festival, all my photos were run through <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mashedfestivals/"">Flickr</a> with video and slideshows broadcast on YouTube.

<strong>Radio Womad</strong>
Being involved with the Radio Womad staff meant audio was a priority, features and ""Secret Sessions"" (essentially backstage acoustic performances), were broadcast on the radio and enhanced for the internet. Unfortunately a big question mark still hangs over whether we have the right to publish this material. I hope we can as the Secret Sessions were fantastic - particularly the session with Bomba Estereo whose improvised instruments included a fire extinguisher and a water bottle.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/BombaEstereo.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-568"" title=""BombaEstereo"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/BombaEstereo.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""500"" /></a>

Radio Womad's backstage gazebo was a perfect platform to let the artists do what they want in their way and I'm delighted there's a digital archive of this ready to be shared with a global audience. I think it would be great for Radio Womad to have a shareable archive of the sessions.

Whilst the video was by no means professional it would offer music fans a glimpse into the unique, unplugged gigs. Also many of the labels and artists liaisons want to see the material so it seems a shame not to share with the wider public. Surely sharing this material would be good for everyone?

<strong>Staff</strong>
My experience with Shambala was essentially to manage a team who in turn managed our Press Gang (teenagers we trained to capture footage on our behalf). For Radio Womad it was about adding value, enhancing social media and putting a multimedia twist on the audio material. Although the Radio Womad team were largely impressed by what I achieved it was difficult to wrangle multimedia stuff (which they were taking personally) off them, in the end I managed to steal memory cards and copy clips from the station server to create my material.

The benefit of the team at Shambala is that we saw the festival through younger eyes. I'd love to work with Radio Womad again but I wonder whether next time the project might benefit from repositioning itself with the main website, which could also help sidestep any reproduction permission issues.

<strong>Moving on</strong>
Whilst for the moment the secret sessions may remain <em>secret</em> it seems to me that this is a direction that I'd been thinking about with <a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/2010/04/village-underground-residency/"">Village Underground ""In The Cab""</a> performances. I know recording and sharing the performance of the artist Marques Toliver secured him several UK gigs because the material was so shareable and exposure extended beyond the 300 people who turned up to see him live. This is an area which I will no-doubt return to when I undertake some more work with Village Underground later this month. As for the festival itself and working with Radio Womad, it was a hugely enjoyable experience and I would love the opportunity to do something next year.

I've collected everything together at the <a href=""http://mashedfestivals.com/radiowomad"">working blog</a>, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/radiowomad"">Facebook</a>, and have hosted all material on the Mashed Festivals <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/mashedfestivals"">Soundcloud</a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mashedfestivals/"">Flickr</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/mashedfestivals"">YouTube</a> Channels.

I would love to know what you think - or if you're interested in working with Mashed Festivals.","Bomba Estereo, etherlive, Mashed Festivals, Multimedia, Radio Womad, radiowomad, Social Media, villageunderground, womad",

Book-ending this content with adverts is a significant revenue driver, although Storm concedes that CPM (cost for thousand impressions) for adverts in the US is higher than here. Interestingly longer stories retain the viewer if the film is interesting enough, Storm gave his own sites stats as an example: the average time on site is 16 minutes. Storm also recommended treading carefully and choosing advertisers and other streams such as sponsorship affiliation should also be explored. <h2>Slow vs Fast</h2> Brian's message is you can be two things with online video: funny or quality. Journalists tend to be better at the latter. We have to consider how longer-tail in-depth production fits into the daily or weekly news cycle.

Journalism Tech Review: ipadio,"Thu, 02 May 2013 13:20:57 +0000",dandavies23,"<em>Originally posted on the Newsroom 360 website, I've decided to post the series on my blog starting with the most recent first. NOTE since I published this series on the website many of the apps and software have been degraded and closed. I'm living them on my site for posterity. </em>
<h1>History</h1>
The fact that this app's name is pronounced I-pay-dio gives some clue to its origins. Long before the iPad was even a glint in Steve Jobs' retina this tool was originally created to host IP Radio, making it easy for people to broadcast from their mobile phone. Instead of just being designed for the slick multimedia prowess of the iPhone, <a title=""ipadio website"" href=""http://www.ipadio.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ipadio</a> was way more utilitarian, enabling people to be able to broadcast on many mobile phones with a reception of 2G or less, and even from satellite phones. At news:rewired they announced the launch of an <a href=""http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/mobile-reporting-ipadio-launches-iphone-app-for-journalists/s2/a552693/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iOS app</a> which like its Android equivalent also has the ability to livecast across a broad spectrum of social media channels.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
According to <a href=""http://youtu.be/fgKPEjfDzNQ?t=30m15s"">ipadio's CEO Dr Mark K Smith</a> there are over 200 uses for ipadio but there are plenty of features useful for journalists. It's particularly good for live news stories because of its efficiency in low bandwidth areas. The fact that you're able to phone in your report also means it can get past internet restricted events, which is why it was used during the Egyptian revolution and is currently being used by someone climbing Everest. It also has a mapping function which makes it perfect for travel journalism or filing back reports from a march. <a href=""http://www.journalism.co.uk/skills/how-to-record-calls-on-an-iphone/s7/a551745/"">Journalism.co.uk</a> have also shown how this phone call function can be used as a conference call to record an interview - which is partially transcribed via Spinvox.
<h1>In practice</h1>
I installed the new iPhone app onto my phone and did a <a href=""http://ipad.io/q2Oj"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">quick quiet test</a>. The system is straightforward to use and you can attach up to four pictures before uploading.

I also uploaded <a href=""http://ipad.io/c4Hg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">an old John Paul Jones interview</a> with pictures or ""Phlog"" to the site. This offered more customisation including the ability to add tags and alter the location.

&nbsp;

After I'd done this Dr Smith (CEO) got in touch with me in person and said he liked the John Paul Jones interview and allowed me to video stream on my phone. I tested out this function with a video that was broadcast and also uploaded to YouTube almost instantly.

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0K2hJ-5jKzI"" width=""420"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

Although this ipadio video Flash embed (which is still in Beta) disturbs my the HTML on this page.

Finally, I tested the audio from both the <a href=""http://ipad.io/b4H3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iPhone recording</a> function:

And <a href=""http://ipad.io/h4OW"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> by phoning my broadcast in</a>:

As expected, the phone-in audio was more condensed than iPhone but both uploaded very quickly, with the latter actually beating the former despite having to run through Spinvox's transcription.

Further conversations with the very helpful Dr Smith led me to discover the Beta Admin function which allows you to fully customise the privacy settings of each broadcast. This means you can keep your phone interviews private but can still report ""as live"" if need be. I was very impressed by the support community around this app including the blog and training videos.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
Only a few minor gripes, I'd say that the audio quality is not as good as Audioboo and that the video doesn't allow you to add metadata on-the-hoof as Bambuser does.
<h1>Summary</h1>
A great tool for filing multimedia stories from the field no matter what device you're on.

Journalism Tech Review: Soo Meta,"Fri, 03 May 2013 07:32:19 +0000",dandavies23,"<em>NOTE: Sooo Meta is sooo over.</em>
<h1>History</h1>
Soo Meta is a browser based editing tool which according to the <a href=""http://www.soometa.com/"">website blurb</a> allows you to create multimedia stories in minutes.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
As well as marketers and educators, this tool was created with journalists in mind ""Viewers expect more and more visual content. It’s time to deliver short movies, rich-media stories in your posts! Your audience will love it!"" Like with Popcorn Maker the idea is that you enrich your original media by adding more multimedia frills. The video demonstrates how to use the Google bookmarklet to collect words, video and images from around the web, this has the added advantage of allowing you to cite your sources.
<h1>In practice</h1>
It took longer than ""a few minutes"" to get to grips with this tool. This is because the demonstration video only shows how to grab material via the bookmarklet, yet it doesn't show you how to install the bookmarklet. Once I'd worked that out I was well into my story. When I attempt to install in Chrome it crashed, I finally installed it in Firefox but was unable to view the video in this browser. I had to complete the edit in Chrome then add the images again (so it carried across the metadata) in Firefox. More than once whilst hopping about I crashed my browser and had to step back.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
Aside from the browser malfunctions, there's very little support for this tool and you are pretty much on your own when it comes to working out what's wrong. Even more unhelpfully if you do try and Google ""Soo cut"" (the name of the bookmarklet) you get a load of ""soo cute"" images and chintzy Google apps.
<h1>Summary</h1>
A great idea which appears simple but can be frustratingly tricky in practice.

Journalism Tech Review: Cowbird,"Mon, 06 May 2013 07:43:16 +0000",dandavies23,"<h1>History</h1>
<a href=""http://cowbird.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cowbird</a> launched on December 8, 2011 and immediately became a place for people from the <a href=""http://cowbird.com/saga/occupy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement to share their stories. Last year <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/08/how-national-geographic-used-cowbird-storytelling-tool-to-tell-a-reservations-whole-story226.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">National Geographic</a> used the website to help residents from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to tell their stories. It's easy to see why it would appeal to National Geographic as it allows you to tell stories with strong images. <a href=""http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/2013/04/12/tip-try-storytelling-tool-cowbird-which-now-has-embed-option/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">A few weeks ago</a> it was announced there is now an embed option, allowing you to place your stories on most websites.
<h1>In practice</h1>
I uploaded a photo and told a small story. Cowbird has a freemium model so one image is the maximum you can upload without paying $60 to become a <a title=""citizenship"" href=""https://cowbird.com/citizenship/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">""citizen""</a>. Other advantages of being a citizen is the ability to link stories and further customise your stories such as adding your own handwriting, adding hyperlinks, changing the colour palate and further interacting with the community. But there's nothing to stop you putting different stories in parallel in one post, but if you wanted to use the platform to collect other people's stories around a subject then you'd have to pay. Although the embed (below) is nice,  on <a href=""http://cowbird.com/story/66418/Young_Monks_And_Drift/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cowbird the story fills the screen</a> and has a stronger impact.

<iframe src=""http://cowbird.com/embed/story/66418/"" width=""540"" height=""540"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

The share (or ""retelling"") facilities are pretty easy for Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. Although, as with many inbuilt auto post functions they don't embed natively to their platform or tag properly. I found it nicer to just use the embed function on <a href=""http://dandavies23.tumblr.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">my Tumblr page</a> for example.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
The stories that you can create are best accompanied by strong photo stories. You can also embed audio so there's nothing to stop you from telling media-rich stories. If you do decide to opt for citizenship then this could all be built into the platform and the multipage option would allow you to tell longer stories, even comic strips or data stories.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
All the best functions come at a price. The embed function is good but the mobile interface is less appealing. Although this is probably not the central aim of this site, it would be difficult to collate a breaking news story, as this requires citizenship.
<h1>Summary</h1>
An intriguing way to tell multimedia stories without learning any HTML.

Journalism Tech Review: Tweetbot,"Thu, 09 May 2013 07:58:30 +0000",dandavies23,"<h1>History</h1>
<a href=""http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/"">Tweetbot</a> took advantage of Twitter’s relatively open API to develop an iPhone native app which easily outshone their basic mobile offering. Although Twitter significantly upped its game with a redesign last year (following the <a href=""http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-iphone.html"">acquisition of Tweetie</a> and its coder), Tweetbot broke free from some of Twitter’s more idealistic attributes - including the patronising and advertising heavy #discover option.
<h1>In practice</h1>
You can very easily flick between multiple accounts, lists and searches. Particularly useful is Tweetbot’s “gestures” - a simple swipe and you can view replies or conversations on any tweet. Tap once to view a link, hold down to use the link or save to any number of apps, or configure triple tap options for yourself.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
For feeding back tweets and multimedia on the move it is very good, especially with the facility to upload in the background. Also, not only can you flick between multiple Twitter personalities (for example public and private you) but you can keep track of Twitter lists. You can even turn a Twitter list into your timeline of contacts’ tweets or monitor keep on top of a story by monitoring a hashtag.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
Although it can be always on you have to drag down to refresh your timeline. If you want to keep abreast of several areas you have to swipe around. Tweetbot only has column based filtering and searching in the iPad app. Both iOS apps come with a £1.99 price tag. And beware, if you like it and want to start using it on your Mac then it’ll cost you £13.99 – apparently raised by Tweetbot to discourage too<a title=""Macworld"" href="" http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/?newsid=3405963""> many users after Twitter restricted its API</a>.  Perhaps because of this, we’re unlikely to see anything developed for Android or PC anytime soon.

A neat, fast and easy way to keep on top of Twitter on your iPhone.

Journalism Tech Review: Learn CSS Layout,"Fri, 10 May 2013 07:44:30 +0000",dandavies23,"<h1>History</h1>
Many of you who have worked with web content management systems or your own personal blog will have a basic understanding of HTML. Just by clicking on the HTML tab or by holding down CTRL+U you can get a grasp of what is going on behind any web page. But CSS can be a mystery as it is rarely placed within HTML (called inline). CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheet” so instructions should be entered into a separate page within a website’s directory.

If you use any website to collect together your stories, build feature ideas or grow an online audience, then knowing the fundamentals of CSS  means you can customise your site to appear more professional. A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is needed if you want to scrape any kind of website, as Classes are often used to mark-up useful information and (as explained in<a href=""http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_3.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> The Data Journalism Handbook</a>) can help convert a web page into a usable spreadsheet format.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
I would have liked more opportunity to try out the code. When you try and apply the CSS there is a missing link which has to be pieced together by reading <a href=""http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/terminology-syntax-intro"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this tutorial</a>. I realised I needed to select the class by writing and using the correct ""selector"". As with many of these tutorials, it’s going to slip straight out of your head if you don’t apply it a few times.
<h1>Summary</h1>
An easy to follow tutorial, which needs further joining up for application.

Journalism Tech Review: IFTTT,"Mon, 13 May 2013 14:47:36 +0000",dandavies23,"If This Then That (<a href=""https://ifttt.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IFTTT</a>) launched in September 2011 promising to be the “gaffer tape that holds the internet together”. This means various social media, cloud archives and even physical internet enabled products (a full list of <a href=""https://ifttt.com/channels"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">channels here</a>) can be connected together with simple instructions and without learning code.
<h1>In practice</h1>
Automated online activity which would require you to wrangle with the unwieldy Yahoo Pipes or the intimidating Mac Automator, is given a user-friendly interface. You can also share your <a href=""https://ifttt.com/recipes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">favourite ‘recipes’</a> and allow people to use them. I use them a lot to allow for a more organic duplication of social media. For example, every image that I 'favourite' on Instagram automatically drops into Tumblr (under the <a href=""http://villageunderground.tumblr.com/tagged/Instagram"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Instagram tag</a>) or when a new photo is uploaded by me to Flickr it also uploads them to a gallery on my <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150311722386415.337244.31887651414&amp;type=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Facebook page</a>. Pictures are the currency of these social media channels and spreading them across platforms increases their exposure and engagement.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
The reason I decided to post about this web application is because of the announcement last week Google is to discontinue its RSS Reader service after July 2013. Since I’ve been experimenting with <a href=""http://www.feedly.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Feedly</a> as a replacement and implementing a process that doesn't leave me relying <a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130313/17262322315/killing-google-reader-highlights-risk-relying-single-provider.shtml"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">too heavily on a single provider</a>. News stories that I like are saved to <a href=""http://getpocket.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pocket</a> from within Feedly and then from Pocket they’re piped with IFTTT to my Delicious and Pinboard bookmarks. This way I can organise my favourite stories and primary sources without depending on one web service. There are other recipes that could help your working life <a href=""https://ifttt.com/recipes/635"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">such as this</a> which (once it allows for UK calls) would let you to effectively dial in a short story. If you were sending back photos or videos from a mobile phone you could speed publish across multiple platforms or notify a desk editor automatically. You can also sync certain documents with Google Drive or even use Google Drive to collect data on a single spreadsheet which might be useful for Data Journalism.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
Although there are 60 active channels on IFTTT with 433,065 tasks created by users in its first year it can be frustrating when you realise that your new app is not included. Particularly disappointing for me is Google Plus’s refusal to let people automate its updates (pages or personal) or Twitter’s restriction of their API. This platform really depends on an open internet.

Journalism Tech Review: FiRE,"Tue, 14 May 2013 06:54:38 +0000",dandavies23,"<em>NOTE: Fire 2 is no longer being updated. Smartphones now have much more sophisticated recording apps inbuilt.</em>

Many apps have been developed to enhance smartphones’ often impressive audio recording ability but FiRe was the first to really attempt to be a professional field recorder. Initially launched on the iPhone (at a pretty high price of £3.99) it did prove to be very reliable so much so that many commercial radio stations (including GMG) encouraged reporters to use it instead of a bulky Marantz. Last year Audiofile stopped supporting FiRe and instead offered FiRe 2 an upgrade of the recorder which required you (somewhat cheekily) to buy it for another £3.99.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
Although there are plenty of apps on the market that are easier to use this one is not only professional but also extremely flexible. You can add your own metadata which prevents the audio getting lost and can help when adding further context to an online story. With FiRe 2 there is integration with Dropbox - blowing <em><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dropvox-record-voice-memos/id416288287?mt=8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dropvox</a></em> out of the water by a considerable distance. A sub or producer could easier pick up a story and it is easier to configure than FTP. There are also some pretty nifty editing tools so you’re out in the field getting an interview anyway you can easily file the audio before the story. And there's Soundcloud integration which in private could be a handy archive but in public could also mean that a story could be broken on the platform.
<h1>In Practice</h1>
To test this app thoroughly, I recorded an interview using a the new app, we recorded it onto the camera microphone in an echoey dressing room whilst the interviewee ate a satsuma. The sound wave monitoring is very accurate which means you can avoid distortion. The noise quality has always been good but there’s a few more EQ settings (powered by Izotope) and extended metadata you can add before downloading. I did try editing the audio using the app but it was very fiddly, and then it crashed. I trimmed the audio (particularly the satusuma sucks) using Audacity on my computer and then uploaded to Audioboo, you get space for unlimited Boo’s on Audioboo whereas I’ve already filled my free Soundcloud account.

<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
You don’t need to have FiRe 1 installed to use FiRe 2 but, somewhat irritatingly it doesn’t incorporate the recordings you have already on the phone. There are a lot file format options on the new app but it does seem buggier than the first version.
<h1>Summary</h1>
An excellent field recorder - an average exporter - a pretty rough editor.

Ken Blake's Excel Data Journalism Videos reviewed (and annotated),"Fri, 17 May 2013 08:50:58 +0000",dandavies23,"<em>NOTE: Video.es website is now closed</em>

Emily Cadman from Financial Times mentioned in her talk at <a href=""http://www.newsrewired.com/2013/04/19/data-driven-journalism-how-to-get-the-information-you-need-and-then-tell-stories/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">News:Rewired</a> Excel is a good ""gateway drug to data"". This idea was also discussed extensively at the <a href=""http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/2013/04/24/ijf13-data-journalism-pointers-and-excel-starter-tips/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">International Journalism Festival in Perugia</a>. Dr Ken Blake from Middle Tennesse State University School of Journalism agrees and through his YouTube-based <a href=""http://mtweb.mtsu.edu/kblake/datajournalism.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Data Journalism course</a>, he takes you from 'the basics' to 'maximizing' Excel.
<h1>In practice</h1>
I downloaded Dr Blake's datasets for <a href=""http://mtweb.mtsu.edu/kblake/raises.xlsx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Introducing Excel</a> and <a href=""http://mtweb.mtsu.edu/kblake/homicide.xlsx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Rates ranks and filters in Excel</a> then I loaded the videos into VideoNot.es (reviewed <a title=""Tech Tuesday: VideoNotes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>).

I also let Dr Blake know I was going to do this and he plans to supply these notes for all of his videos in the next few weeks.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
Dr Blake's tutorials look at using Excel specifically for Data Journalism, and he uses examples of sources which you may use in a newsroom including crime figures and population statistics.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
These are drawbacks with Excel rather than the tutorials. Of course, being a Microsoft product the software is always updating and if they have a significant overhaul (as they did in 2010) then these videos will appear dated. Excel was never designed as a Data Journalism tool, rather as a small office spreadsheet system. It is worth keeping this in mind when working on more complex projects.

Putting together slick multimedia packages with Videolicious,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 10:19:05 +0000",dandavies23,"The iOS app <a href=""https://videolicious.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Videolicious</a> was<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/02/videolicious-helps-you-edit-good-videos-fast/""> launched</a> a couple of years ago with the idea of allowing you to quickly create multimedia stories on-the-hoof. Last week journalism and technology website Poynter <a href=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/215291/videolicious-one-way-reporters-can-make-and-file-decent-videos-from-their-iphones/"">revealed</a> The Washington Post asks journalists without multimedia backgrounds, to use the app.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
This app is great for putting together quick packages whilst out in the field, press conferences, Marches or gigs. In Poynter’s demo Andrew Beaujon uses it from a technology and journalism conference.

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7xaxfhcUbKE"" height=""315"" width=""560"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

Once you're happy with your piece, you have the option to add licence free music and even filters. If you upgrade from the free version you can add licensed music and logos to make your video more professional. You then have the option of sending to YouTube or it can be shared directly via Videolicious’ own player and dashboard.
<h1>In practice</h1>
I created a quick dispatch based on an event I covered last week. It was relatively quick to put together, although I retrofitted it and had to spend time downloading the elements to my phone. The app requires you to do your post in one take, so I had to do quite a few retakes. This arguably, is good practice but not so good if you’re used to sorting out problems in the edit suite. Also the camera is really unflattering (especially if your shooting from a desk upward) and I was much more comfortable with just audio. A good point is that you can upload a high or lo-res version depending on whether you’ve got good phone coverage or not.

<iframe id=""to_hide"" style=""border: 0px solid #ffffff; position: relative; z-index: 1;"" src=""http://api.videolicious.com/videolicious/embedded_video?video_id=5343d583-8d2f-42b0-88af-43062e21f960#375"" height=""375"" width=""600"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

My attempt to upload to my YouTube account didn't work.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
Surprisingly, even though it’s a few years old, Videolicious does tend to crash. But then my iPhone is in need of an upgrade and it might deal better with images and video shot on the phone. I would have liked more of a chance to fix things retrospectively but the video can upload to a dashboard where potentially a multimedia editor could pick it up, check and re-edit if need be.
<h1>Summary</h1>
An app with real potential, but it needs practice. And possibly a recent smartphone.

Using Clipping Magic - deleting picture backgrounds without being tricky,"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 16:06:21 +0000",dandavies23,"It’s in no doubt that the Adobe suite of software is still the market leader when it comes to image manipulation. However, because they’re so powerful it can be heavy, taking a long time to load the software. A simple job such such as cutting out an image can take forever and with all the tools and options on offer, it’s difficult to remember how to do it. <a href=""http://clippingmagic.com/"">Clipping Magic</a> is an browser based solution for this specific problem, currently free in Alpha.

<h1>In practice</h1>
I quickly made a logo transparent for a video that I'd been working on. The interface is very easy to use, you simply mark green on the area you wish to keep and red on the area you want removed.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-18-at-11.10.50-AM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-952"" alt=""Screen shot 2013-06-18 at 11.10.50 AM"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-18-at-11.10.50-AM.png"" width=""793"" height=""190"" /></a>

Unlike Photoshop or Illustrator you can be pretty rough and ready with the area you want to remove. On an image as clear as this, the interface works out what you wish to do. Black background added below to distinguish difference.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/techonologylogocroppedcleaned_clipped_rev_3.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-954"" alt=""techonologylogocroppedcleaned_clipped_rev_3"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/techonologylogocroppedcleaned_clipped_rev_3-1024x244.jpeg"" width=""540"" height=""128"" /></a>

I then tried something a bit more challenging for last week's Tech review slide and a black and white picture of Damo Suzuki.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/leopardtyping_clipped_cropped_rev_1.png""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-955"" alt=""leopardtyping_clipped_cropped_rev_1"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/leopardtyping_clipped_cropped_rev_1-300x298.png"" width=""300"" height=""298"" /></a>   <a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Damo-Suzuki-Village-Underground_clipped_cropped.png""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-956"" alt=""Damo Suzuki Village Underground_clipped_cropped"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Damo-Suzuki-Village-Underground_clipped_cropped-226x300.png"" width=""226"" height=""300"" /></a>

There are more tools to help you refine or blur the edges, this was particularly useful when trying the make the coat look normal on the leopard and Damo's hair not look too ""bob-ish"", as Clipping Magic calls it.

<a href=""http://www.newsroom360.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-18-at-2.04.48-PM.png""><a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-18-at-2.03.46-PM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-957"" alt=""Screen shot 2013-06-18 at 2.03.46 PM"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-18-at-2.03.46-PM.png"" width=""863"" height=""578"" /></a></a>

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-18-at-2.04.48-PM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-958"" alt=""Screen shot 2013-06-18 at 2.04.48 PM"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screen-shot-2013-06-18-at-2.04.48-PM.png"" width=""628"" height=""448"" /></a>

With these images you need to help the algorithm out a bit more, but it's considerably easier than the magnetic lasso and wand tools in Adobe. The refinement tools are also simple.
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
Time is often of the essence and using this tool prevents the need to load Photoshop or Illustrator for a simple task. It also means you can cut out photos on any computer without the cost and time spent installing the Adobe suite.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
According to the website this application is free whilst still in Alpha, hopefully the cost won't be too prohibitive and a paywall doesn't impede the speed of access to this tool. If you did want to do a professional crop - something that would be used in print, it would always be better in Adobe.
<h1>Summary</h1>
A quick and easy cutting out tool, much more magic than Adobe's wand.

<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Tim-Burgess.jpeg""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-964"" alt=""Tim Burgess"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Tim-Burgess.jpeg"" width=""500"" height=""362"" /></a>

Feeding into the band was a pudding bowl of musical influences. Although their haircuts and swagger cashed in on Madchester, they were essentially outside the city. As Burgess’ autobiography affectionately details (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1bZe1RI"" target=""_blank"">new updated edition out July 4th</a>) they stirred in elements of The Byrds and The Meters from the very beginning. Additional remixes by the fledgling Chemical Brothers created a unique blend.

As the band rose, and Burgess broadened his lyrical palate, bits of Dylan and Gutherie crept into Tellin’ Stories. Then as Burgess expanded his vocal scale there was even a touch of Curtis Mayfield mixed with mid-western slide guitars and occasional gospel choirs joining the congregation on Us And Us Only.

Burgess’ involvement with Lambchop followed after he went to see them at a gig in Manchester then helped lead singer Kurt Wagner load his van. Burgess asked him whether he’d like to work with them to which Wagner replied, “you write the music, I’ll write the lyrics”.

Tonight, Wagner tells us that when he first met Tim he wasn’t quite sure who he was. He’s also distracted by Tim’s hair when he comes on to duet during Lambchop's set quipping “what happened? when I met him he looked normal you know quite preppy, is it because he’s gone vegetarian?” Wagner’s easy humour is a contrast to his gentle yet lyrically dense tales that have a soporific effect on a warm Sunday evening.

To be fair, Tim’s pudding bowl haircut bears a striking resemblance to his early years, cut when he was writing the chart-topping Weirdo and perhaps the new straw coloured thatch is a nod toward his alt.country roots?

When Lambchop is replaced by Burgess’ band after the interval, the influence is clear and the lush sound, similarly interchangeable. Wagner stood by his word and worked with Burgess on his most recent solo album <a href=""http://timburgessmusic.com/oh-no-i-love-you/"" target=""_blank"">Oh No I Love You</a>, Tim still reverts to a trademark pimp shuffle when he delivers Wagner’s lyrics and the songs have a bit more bounce to them than a standard Lambchop tale but it’s an authentic take rather than a pale Northern imitation. Or what Tim calls “Mid North-Western”.

<iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/Z0JWtXw7AfM"" width=""560"" height=""315"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

Obviously the biggest ripples of recognition are with the key-changed Charlatans songs. Starting with The Only One I Know then bringing on a string quartet for White and the already country hued A Man Needs To Be Told is taken to new heights. Wagner partners up for Weirdo and it’s at this point that you release that he is as much an outsider to country as Burgess. As Burgess’ set increases, so do the number of Lambchop members until finally there's a full ensemble performance of the closest Wagner ever had to a cross over bouncy chart hit, Up With People.

As the recent remix album of <a href=""http://bit.ly/10OC2ui"" target=""_blank"">Oh No I Love You</a> highlighted, it’s also refreshing to see an artist who won’t settle into a trend and solely chug out the back catalogue. Unlike rock dinosaurs headlining Glastonbury this weekend, Tim Burgess refuses to be stuck in a musical rut or, indeed, framed by a (Jesus) hairdo.

Creating responsive news stories with Webflow,"Fri, 13 Sep 2013 10:15:07 +0000",dandavies23,"NOTE: This service has since been retired and the partially completed website has been removed, as Wordpress sites in general have improved. When I have time I'll rebuild the project here.

This browser-based application which allows you to visually design responsive websites came out of Beta in August this year. Instead of having to know HTML or rely on a desktop based webdesign software such as Dreamweaver, <a title=""Webflow website"" href=""https://webflow.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Webflow</a> allows you to drag and drop the main elements of a website into a canvas area and then preview the website in different formats, such as tablet and smartphone or portrait and landscapes. This means that no matter what device you're viewing on you can customize the appearance quickly and easily.
<h1>In practice</h1>
I made two websites to test how easy this application was to use. Firstly, I very quickly knocked together a website ahead of an editorial meeting for a fanzine I'm working on. I based this site on a pre-designed template which already had a clear structure and just customized the text within the containers. Secondly I started to reproduce a web story from scratch, which I had previously <a href=""http://www.scrollkit.com/s/jegiYjk"">created using Scrollkit</a>, the Webflow version can be found here. The latter required more adaption and an understanding of how Webflow worked and although support videos exist on how to quickly put together storefront style websites, there's no guidance on how to create scrolling news stories. Having said this once I'd got my head round the various web containers, margins and padding it achieved a much clearer and legible mobile site.
<a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-shot-2013-09-03-at-2.56.59-PM.png""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-989"" src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-shot-2013-09-03-at-2.56.59-PM-1024x562.png"" alt=""Life in Lake Vostok on Webflow"" width=""540"" height=""296"" /></a>
<h1>How it helps you</h1>
The key really here is speed, to be able to bring together some visual ideas and even put together a microsite quickly is really exciting. And for that to be readable across devices without having to constantly test the website is brilliant. Particularly when designing scrolling news stories, it's all too easy to get the measurements wrong and lose half your audience. Also whilst you still need to understand the principles of webdesign, you no longer have to write badly formed HTML. Once you've published the website, it can be outputted as easy to install zip folders with perfect HTML and CSS.
<h1>Drawbacks</h1>
As with Scrollkit (which I also wrote about on a previous Tech Tuesday), this application comes unstuck when you start embedding multimedia into it. Compared to Scrollkit the embed is much easier, although you can't preview an embed that isn't iframe based without publishing. The hardest thing to embed was YouTube video, using the video embed it created it within a small window on the canvas. As an iframe embed it previewed fine then in the final viewing shot into the middle of the page. I could probably work out how to stop this with more time but it is frustrating. Also there's no CMS (content management system) powering these websites, so creating something that can be easily added to is problematic.
<h1>Summary</h1>
Another incredibly flexible web-based application which gives desktop software a run for its money, but needs a bit more time to mature.

Trip to Interzone: a Burroughsian interview with Guerilla Zoo's James Elphick,"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 12:09:03 +0000",dandavies23,"<em>Originally published on <a href=""http://www.run-riot.com/articles/blogs/interview-dan-davies-takes-trip-interzone-guerilla-zoo%E2%80%99s-creative-director-and-willia#permalink"">Run Riot</a></em>

On Friday (7 Feb 2014) an undisclosed part of London will slide into the realms of <a href=""http://www.guerrillazoo.com/interzone-burroughs-100.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Interzone</strong></a>. You’re invited to join the <em>“misfits, terrorists, traffickers of delusion, tribes, deviants, delinquents, corrupt officials, Beatniks, Mugwumps, government agents, re-occurring dream characters, lady boys, drag kings, cannibals, merchants of sex, time travellers, practitioners of the Dark Arts, people who aren’t allowed on planes, gypsies, Egyptian Gods, Arabian royalty, Sufi dervishes and Moroccan hawkers” </em>for a night inside the lucid and fully realised mind of <strong>William S Burroughs</strong>. This promenade performance and party of excess will mark what would be the writer’s 100th birthday.

Burroughs merged with the infinite in 1997 but his literary legacy and cultural prominence still stands firm and proud. As one of key inquisitors of the Beat movement, Old Bull Lee (a pseudonym that he and his peers used) presided over the Beatniks with a bloodshot but steel-eyed stare. He was both brutally honest about his “junk” dependency yet took fantastical cut up creative kicks. <em>Interzone</em> was the netherworld which he conjured and inhabited - partly 1950s Tangier in Morocco and partly the world that he slipped into when he was dreaming or hallucinating.

Guerilla Zoo have incited <em>Interzone</em> before, the immersive performance with music, film and art thrown together to create an exploded Burroughs bubble, that has the blessing of his estate. After listening to Burroughs’ distinctive hardboiled drawl in spoken word readings all morning, I interviewed <strong>James Elphick</strong>. Apologies if some of Bull Lee has worked its way into the interrogation, it’s a habit that’s near impossible to kick…

<strong>Dan Davies: People tend to come to Burroughs through the back channels how did you become acquainted with him?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick: </strong>My first taste of Burroughs was reading <em>Naked Lunch</em>. I'd never read anything quite like it before; a nightmarish world of lucid precision taking the lurid and profane with a sprinkling of dark comedy. A bustling, whirling, unwinding, universe of previously un-uttered perversions and stark naked realities hit me off centre, knocked my thoughts off their feet and into uncharted territories. I explored his Naropa Lectures and the many mind machines he mentioned (such as the Dreamachine) and found a man who somehow through all of the events his life brought, really knew what was going on.

<strong>Dan Davies: What first appealed to you about the way he flipped the script?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick: </strong>Burroughs saw the world with a highly educated un-nerving lucidity. His experiences across his long life had many highs and lows, despite this he remained on top of his game and even into his last years was highly productive and creative. His books, his collaborations (especially with Brion Gysin), his artworks, his methods, really broke down the walls of freedom and expression and manifested new ways of creating.

<strong>Dan Davies: Why do you think he was such a supreme hit for people yet remained a permanent fix through time and space?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick: </strong>Burroughs' writings are a right of passage for many younger readers. He's talent for routing out the relevant and making it stand strong with the parallels of today, which make his work extremely relevant now. He touched on subjects way back that have only now been making headlines such as Julian Assange's Wikileaks and Edward Snowden's NSA revelations.

He was very well read, looked deep into historical, religious, political references, current press media and trends, and his own minds eye.  He was informed by a lifetime of dialogue with provocative and penetrating thinkers. Often these interactions sparked new directions in writing, film, sound, and visual art. Notable collaborators include Antony Balch, Ian Sommerville, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Keith Haring, Robert Wilson, Tom Waits, Kurt Cobain, John Giorno and Terry Southern. His works have inspired countless people especially musicians including, David Bowie, The Beatles, Thurston Moore and The Klaxons, to name but a few.

<strong>Dan Davies: You've ventured to Interzone before, what's happening? What gives?  </strong>

<strong>James Elphick: </strong>Here's a quote -<em> ""Hipsters with smooth copper-colored faces lounge in doorways twisting shrunk heads on gold chains, their faces blank with an insect's unseeing calm. Behind them, through open doors, tables and booths and bars, and kitchens and baths, copulating couples on rows of brass beds, crisscross of a thousand hammocks, junkies tying up for a shot, opium smokers, hashish smokers, people eating talking bathing back into a haze of smoke and steam. The City is visited by epidemics of violence, and the untended dead are eaten by vultures in the streets... A place where the unknown past and the emergent future meet in a vibrating soundless hum. Larval entities waiting for a Live One .""</em> - Edited extract from <em>Naked Lunch.</em>

Burroughs' stateless city of <em>Interzone</em> is a vast visual realm of inspiration. It was a perfect opportunity to bring something very special together. In 2008 Guerrilla Zoo did our previous<em>Interzone</em> event, which was picked up by the papers and was a great success. I'm not kidding, it has been cited by many as ""<em>best night out in London ever. Ever!</em>"" So with this being Burroughs' centenary year I thought for one night only, to open the doors to the city once more. This is an experiential event on many levels but also a party to celebrate Burroughs 100th birthday. Buy your ticket to travel. Pack your Passport. Step into a microcosm of all the world by moonlight.

<strong>Dan Davies: How do you get your audience to loosen up and lose themselves and their minds?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick: </strong>They have free reign to move through the space, they can engage and discover moments to get lost in or they can be passive observers, it depends how far down the rabbit hole they are willing to go.

<strong>Dan Davies: Will Old Bull Lee be your guide through Interzone or is it every man woman and child for themselves in there?</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>James Elphick:</strong> There will be some recognisable characters from his books to engage with, but Interzone is for you to explore, there are no guides here, it is all about your own self discovery.

<strong>Dan Davies: How do you induce the atmosphere of Interzone?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick: </strong>One example would be working with Gorilla Perfume, who are providing special scents, which is a powerful play on the audience's subconscious to pick up on.  One in particular is a sort of paranoid inducing smell called '<em>The Bug</em>' for some of the more tense scenarios.

<strong>Dan Davies: Burroughs work can often be filmic in written delivery and dialogue yet impossible to fully realise off the page how do you approach this contradiction?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick:</strong> I'm not adapting word for word like a play, Interzone is an interpretation, inspired by the many universes of Burroughs writings. Much like how David Cronenberg's adaptation of<em>Naked Lunch</em> was part novel, part biographical, part Cronenbergian dreamworld!

<strong>Dan Davies: What do you think interested the executors of his estate in your general demeanour?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick: </strong>I want to introduce Burroughs works to a new generation and bring his legacy to new eyes. Interzone is just one way of connecting people to hear about him and to encourage them to pick up one of his brilliant books. I also co run <a href=""http://www.burroughs100.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.burroughs100.com</a>, which is the official Burroughs website, full of articles, exclusive features, rare material and listings for many events happening around the world.

<strong>Dan Davies: Can you give us an insight into the musical accompaniment for the evening?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick:</strong> We have an eclectic varied line up of genres from Sufi trance inducing sounds, jazz music of the era, to cut-up inspired performances, busking musicians, to underground dance music to get the party going.

<strong>Dan Davies: Do you have any words of advice for young people?</strong>

<strong>James Elphick:</strong> I think Burroughs put's it best in <a href=""http://youtu.be/YqBIgCb7dv0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this Youtube clip</a>:

Jamie McDermott is late for his interview because he's just confirmed a wedding booking. Whereas with other bands this largely involves covering <em>The Commitments</em> to a room that's too busy getting drunk to give a toss, for Jamie it might just be the highlight of his career. At the end of the month The Irrepressibles will play the first gay wedding in the UK.
<em>""I think it's going be one of most beautiful evenings of my life, it will be incredible,"" </em>says Jamie,<em>""We're going to be playing Two Men In Love, as they get married.""</em>

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/QImH6snSN-g"" height=""338"" width=""600"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

For two albums and three recent EPs his band have flitted between musical styles like a cultured yet populist iPod on permanent shuffle but one thing has remained constant: enduring love and the belief that everyone has a right to it. It feels odd that in the 21st century that this is still an issue. I ask Jamie whether he thinks we have gone backwards rather than forwards in recent years, particularly when we look at arcane laws that Russia and other countries enforce.

<em>""We were over in Russia recently and were able to see the situation first hand. In many ways they are far freer than under the communist regime. Really now the problem is that it's ruled by a religious dictator who got into his position via his relationship with the Russian orthodox church. In terms of ex-colonial countries, there's very much a legacy from the British missionaries, it's still very active and that's not going to be affected by Western politics. And of course, there is much more of a systematic hard line in the way they deliver the penalty.""</em>

The Irrepressibles performed a free concert in Gorky Park, Moscow last year. As a band with openly gay members who unashamedly confront this with their music, this was an extremely brave decision and not one that Jamie took lightly.

<em>""It was terrifying, I cried on the train on the way there, more for the band than myself because they were so steady and determined to do it. And a lot of them are straight, including the two drummers at the back of the band but they were so behind it. So much so actually, that when the Russian technical staff refused to play our video, one of the drummers threw his sticks at them!""</em>

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/46yRzlRxzF0"" height=""338"" width=""600"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

This wasn't a video that reached Frankie Goes To Hollywood levels of Bacchanalian excess, it featured gay male couples kissing. Controversial in Russia perhaps, but it is also an idea so ""abhorrent"" that it frequently gets their beautiful, honest and affectionate videos banned on social networks. Jamie's response isn't to tone this down, it's to coerce more couples into kissing, and filming that. The aforementioned video for <em>Two Men In Love</em> features a crescendo of canoodling couples and last week the video of their forthcoming release <em>The Edge of Now</em> saw their fans recreating the ""restricted"" <em>Arrow</em> video of two men wrestling with their emotions, and each other. I ask Jamie about his relationship with his audience.

<em>""In some respects I'm not really a traditional pop star in the way that I don't really have much of a guard. I've performed in different garbs and have taken to different ways of performing. It's quite funny actually, I met some guys at one point and they thought I'd be really haughty and arrogant and I guess that's sometimes the way we appear on stage but we don't have that attitude really. The important thing for me is trying to say something about a time that is honest. It's about telling a story about something that's real when it communicates properly that's a wonderful thing. It's always really scary when I bring out new work because I worry that others might not like it. Making videos about a group of people saying something is a really wonderful thing.""</em>

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/hiBY0oaiTv0"" height=""338"" width=""600"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

<em>Nude</em> is the name of The Irrepressibles last album and the recent three EPs were also <em>Nude </em>variants. <em>Nude:Viscera</em> the most recent EP saw the band (pun intended) stripped down to the bare essentials of guitar and light orchestration. It's hugely impactful - nothing is dressed up or obscured, just a raw soaring vocal coming straight from the heart, as nature intended.

<em>""Nude originally was an album that I made before I was signed,""</em> says Jamie <em>""the idea was to perform the songs on a guitar in one go. Then when we looked at mixing the album with The Irrepressibles I wanted to make something that was broader… that also represented the time that the songs were written in. When I finished the record there were songs that didn't fit the main record. They weren't any less songs but they were too raw and mine. These songs needed to be released in some way so the idea was to do a second part, but they didn't fit on one record. So the idea was to inhabit three different worlds with three different EPs.""</em>

The Irrepressibles performance at Village Underground will be stripped down, Jamie explains the set up in more detail.

<em>""The set-up is a five piece rock band, with a grunge exotica feel. We've got piano, viola, cello and guitar - it's a really wonderful sound. It's quite exciting for me because we usually have something that's very set or electronic, it's good to have movement. The musicians are wonderful. There's no chance of a big spectacle with this, it's about the energy of playing punchy loud rock music.""</em>

We wonder if Jamie will be stage-diving?

<em>""I don't think so,""</em> he says with a little laugh.

WOMAD 2014: 'The friendliest and most open event anyone could wish to attend',"Wed, 06 Aug 2014 20:27:19 +0000",dandavies23,"Review originally published on <a href=""http://www.virtualfestivals.com/latest/news/14775"">Virtual Festivals</a>

Since its creation by the prog-rock primate playing Peter Gabriel, it's often wrongly assumed that WOMAD Festival’s rosta follows similar narrowly defined white lines. In fact, it can be the friendliest and most open event anyone could wish to attend. This mix of goodwill, genuine enthusiasm and passion spills from the organisers down to the artists and audience.
<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3749.jpg""><img src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3749.jpg"" alt=""IMG_3749.JPG"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>

WOMAD is unique as it brings the world to the festival goer - artists and bands from 42 different countries played at this year’s sold-out festival, the first time WOMAD has sold out since the event moved from its Reading site in 2007. Musicians are given the power to push beyond cultural and language barriers to really thrill and surprise onlookers. Often first-timers walk around this festival, discovering new, unheard of artists, leading them to say: ""Why isn't this artist bigger than Beyoncé?""

<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3746.jpg""><img src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3746.jpg"" alt=""IMG_3746.JPG"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>

One artist who could certainly out-booty Beyoncé would be Eno Williams from Ibibio Sound Machine (9). Williams gives a wonderful performance, embodying a female Fela Kuti with added dancehall attitude. Her guitarist, Alfred ""Kari"" Bannerman - who played many early WOMADs as part of Peter Gabriel’s band - adds extra rockstar cred and sheer dexterity to the eight-strong band. One other new discovery is Daka Brakha (10), a Ukrainian band distinguished by their tall hats, akin to Horse Guards’ Busbys. Although their dress might be traditional, their sound certainly isn’t. During their Siam Tent set there’s a rapping cellist, touches of techno and a guitarist who could stand in for Jonzi from Sigur Ros.

<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3748.jpg""><img src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3748.jpg"" alt=""IMG_3748.JPG"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>

The BBC Radio 3 Stage moved from the Arboretum into the main arena this year, and continues to champion interesting artists. From the trip-hop folk of the Welsh singing 9Bach (9) through to Amira Kheir (8), a Sudanese-Italian artist whose opening song sounds like 'Thali'. An unfortunate reminder to rumbling stomachs, because the voluntary run Madras Cafe next door don’t start serving their unbeatable thalis until after 12:30pm. 

There are headliners of course. New Zealand’s Fat Freddy’s Drop (7) swing by as part of the UK summer festival tour and work the audience with their irresistible dub tracks with sweet soulful vocals. The legendary Richard Thompson (8) at his ripe age continues to prove himself more adept than ever with one acoustic guitar - although it sounds like three. And Sinead O’ Connor’s (7) voice remains as clear as cut glass and she’s still fighting (well, boxing) fit, dedicating her set to the late Bobby Womack who had been booked to headline the festival.
<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3744.jpg""><img src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3744.jpg"" alt=""IMG_3744.JPG"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>

On an equal billing are world music superstars such as Mulatu Astatke (7) whose Ethiopian vibraphone Jazz is continually referenced and sampled as pointed out by his version of ""Yègellé Tezeta"" which enters into Nas and Damian Marley’s version. The divine Mali diva Fatoumata Diawara teamed up with Havana pianist Roberto Fonseca and the combination of exquisite voice and deft Latino groove is another winner (8). And Songhoy Blues (9) the biggest thrill of Africa Express have a mournful indie quality made all the more poignant when reacting to real conflict in Timbuktu rather than the usual British bedsit blues.

Another main attraction this year is the addition of the Society of Sound Tent which uses a Bowers and Wilkins speaker system of Abbey Road studio fame. David Holmes (7) utilises the quadrophonic surround speakers to play rare Northern Soul records as crackling vinyl ricochets around the four banks on Friday. The next day, Peter Gabriel spends a morning talking about the importance of hi-fidelity but the sound is so smartly directional that from outside the tent it's virtually inaudible. Ashley Beedle (8) brings up the bottom end on Saturday with some disco and finger-pointing house. On Sunday, the real test of the system is when the stage is filled with old electronic equipment as The Radiophonic Workshop (8) bring their backroom boffin skills to the fore. The sound of many a geeky 1970's Beeb show are audibly panned to full effect and given a bit of pep by The Prodigy's former live drummer. Obviously, The Doctor Who theme wig-out finale is what everyone is waiting for.

Some of the best highlights this year were off the sun-beaten track in the Arboretum, sat appropriately under a tree by the solar-powered Ecotricity stage. Sans (8) music is mix of hypnotic Finnish mythological tales given a dramatic bite. Imed Alibi’s (9) percussive Tunisian beats make a sweltered hot audience dance with the kind of swirling arm gesturing movements that you only see at this festival. It’s here, as the smell of honeysuckle wafts from the trees and as Taste of Womad serves up another delightful dish concocted by the band playing on stage, it truly feels like you’re at the core of the festival.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3747.jpg""><img src=""http://www.dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_3747.jpg"" alt=""IMG_3747.JPG"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>","Gigs, Mashed Festivals",
Suuns are back and “It feels like a crazy slap in the face”,"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 12:37:40 +0000",dandavies23,"<p dir=""ltr"">This was published on <a href=""http://vuzine.villageunderground.co.uk/suuns-interview/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Village Underground's VUzine</a>, which I edit. Although Ava Hapgood pulled together the final article, I'm very pleased with the format. The article is possibly the most Blowbackian format since Blowback.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Let’s set the scene: It’s four in the afternoon in London, eleven in the morning in Montreal. Dan is sat in a recycled Jubilee line tube train on top of Village Underground in Shoreditch, amid the sounds of computer keys and answering messages for the venue’s office. Around 3,243 miles away, Joe, guitarist, bassist and founding member of Suuns, can be found in his home just a few blocks from Montreal’s Breakglass Studios, where their second album, Images Du Futur, came into being.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Throughout the interview, life is condensed and pushed across the Atlantic - traffic grinds by as car horns congregate, children goad for attention and the phone buttons are accidentally pressed, the signal drops, echoes and distorts. These bursts disrupt the conversation like Suuns music: the drone and hum of technology of modern living with surprising sounds taking them in new directions. Breaking forms, reshuffling order.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Almost two years since their first show at VU, Suuns will return to Shoreditch this September with a new album for a new stage- an eigen pun that serves to highlight just how much has evolved for a band previously named after nothing.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">D: Hi Joe- we thought we’d grab a little interview with you ahead of your performance at VU. Last time you played here was two years ago and you were on our smaller stage setup underneath the arches. This time you’ll be in the main space, a move which you must see happening a lot for the second album run of tours and gigging. Do you think playing to larger audiences affects the atmosphere on stage?</p>

J: Yes I do remember that gig- and I think in general we are just a different band, so I think it will be a different show than it was almost two years ago. I think that will affect it more than the space but who knows I mean, it kinda seemed more like a warehouse vibe back then…
<p dir=""ltr"">D: Yep it’s still very much got that vibe! Is there a danger as you become more popular that you lose that intimacy and response from a small audience? Do you think there’s a risk that something gets lost when you scale up?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">J: I think that someone can always find a reason to claim it’s not as intimate- which is totally understandable- but I guess naturally it would happen if you were playing a bigger venue and by definition be less intimate. But we take that into consideration- all that’s changed really is the venue itself and that we’re a better band, so hopefully we can create an intimate space.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em>In what sounds like the outer edges of the conversation, rain begins to pound onto the roof of VU’s offices, reverberating off onto the EC2 pavement below and taking over the long-distance phone call at hand. Joe’s voice is almost totally obscured by the now very noisy, classic end-of British summertime fanfare.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">D: Sorry about the rain interference by the way, we’re up on the roof, so when it rains we really hear it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">J: That’s awesome!</p>
D: So I guess-  [<em>Shouting over the angry rain</em>] - I guess a lot of people when they talk about your music focus on it sounding violent or aggressive- do you identify with that at all? Or is it more of a kind of raw energy?

J: I can see why people think that, but it’s definitely not where these things are coming from. It just happens that a lot of the time our songs end up that way, and it’s good, it makes the show a lot more intriguing and we don’t really have too many pop elements that are ‘happy’. I don’t really know how it happened - I know bands that use the same sort of set ups as us and it’s not at all the same so - a lot of it has to do with the vocals I’m sure- especially live- when we use a lot of harsh elements.
<p dir=""ltr"">[<em>Rain continues</em>]</p>
D: Yeah I think there is a visceral element- it’s that approach that hits home- it’s about the energy really rather than being outwardly aggressive or setting out to make ‘angry music’ as such.
<p dir=""ltr"">J: It’s not like we’re trying to do any hardcore music- we’re definitely just trying to take it to a different place.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">[<em>The rain fades into the distance, Dan is able to hear himself speak again</em>.]</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">D: Going back to your first album- what did you feel you’ve learnt from that and how did it affect your approach to Images Du Futur?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">J: The first one was a very different record, we were completely independent, and we definitely made that record on our own time, a hundred per cent. The downside to that was we didn’t have much money or that much time to do it. We had been playing those songs for the better part of two years, and it’s kind of like we rushed in, played most of them live and then did a few overdubs. Luckily we had a few days to mix them, and that was it. We chose ten songs we thought would make a great album and then we got signed basically immediately and then started touring.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Images was really songs that were written in a short period of time in early 2012, and sound and cohesion-wise, the songs are a lot better, in respect that it sounds more like an album that came from a certain period. But that had its challenges as well- a lot of songs were not tested live, so we were just sort of working on them in the studio and we had no idea if they would really do well live before we started recording them. I hope it’s not a case where each record will be the magnetic opposite of the previous ones- but I don't think so.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">[<em>In the background now in Montreal, a child demands attention</em>]</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A child: DDDADDYYYY!</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">J: I think there’s a lot -</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">C: DADDY!</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">J: There’s a lot we’ve taken from -</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">J: Sorry, hold on, my son’s here. Just go with Mommy for two minutes- [child is led/ carried away] he gets jealous that I’m in another room. Anyway. Back to that- there’s so much we’ve taken from both experiences that we can remember and apply for the next one- which is basically happening very soon.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-183"" alt=""SC260"" src=""http://vuzine.villageunderground.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SC260.jpg"" width=""900"" height=""900"" /></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">D: You’ve named your album after the Images Du Futur exhibitions in Montreal, and you’ve all lived there for at least ten years- do you think the album in a way celebrates that legacy of Montreal?</p>
J: There’s a definite lifestyle to this city and it’s especially good to musicians. It’s cheap to live here, everything is very close and compact- I walk five minutes to my studio and so does every other member of our band. Everything we kind of do is in some way an homage to this place just because it’s been such an influence on us- this band would not have started. It means we’ve been able to put a lot of work into the band because we don’t need to put a lot of work into surviving. It frees us up to be really devoted to do what we want to do, which is priceless, really.

D: Looking “to the future” now- do you view it as being essentially dystopic, is that the kind of future we’re going towards, or are we headed to a cleaner, brighter, better future?
<p dir=""ltr"">J: Every time I think of the future it’s like a fake future to me. I always think of when I was six years old and I thought about the future and there’s those 80s movies where it’s always dark and smoke everywhere- but living in the age we live in, I don’t think [the future] is necessarily good but I don’t think it will be dystopic. If anything it will hopefully be positive. I gotta believe that.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">D: In a way that’s why the Image Du Futur [formally an <a href=""http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=342"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">annual festival in Montreal</a>] was so interesting, because it was about celebrating the possibilities of the future rather than thinking we’re all doomed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">J: Definitely. And it was a take on how we used to view the future- it’s like this retro view of the future, which is awesome. It’s great to see predictions come true, and what didn’t come true. So it’s kind of about realising that you make that happen, slowly. It sounds so cheesy and the name of the record can be so cheesy, but that’s exactly it. It can be exactly what you make of it.</p>

Confronting Retail Trading Stats,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 13:45:05 +0000",,"<h4>Why in a tightly regulated yet competitive market aren’t investors doing better with trading apps? And what can Finatext UK do to buck this trend? Rob Brockington digs deeper than the industry average.</h4>
Let’s address the elephant in the room. According to statistics researched by the FCA, ‘between 74% and 89% of retail clients trading CFDs will lose money’. This is not very encouraging.

An industry which should be intent on growing personal wealth by managed investment should be doing better. Yet, is a nagging sense of failure all we can take from these figures? What other questions should we be asking in such a cut-and-dried assessment of past results?

Let’s make one thing clear. We certainly don’t wish to question the quality or veracity of the FCA study. It provides strong evidence of a well-regulated industry, the above statistic is a mandatory accompaniment to promotional materials published by any new business in the sector.

This particular text is required for all new businesses who do not have customers’ performance data. So, only the newcomers are obliged to use this ‘industry average’. Those trading more than 12 months’ records still need to add a ‘risk warning’ but they can use their own data instead. If it’s better than the industry average of course!

[caption id=""attachment_79805"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-79805 size-full"" src=""https://dandavies23.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Chicago-board-of-trade-1024x658-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""658"" /> The traditional light show on a trading floor[/caption]
<h3>Facts &amp; Figures</h3>
So what is the purpose of the stat? Well, this also should be stated on the same ‘risk warning’. Though you might wonder what else a warning serves to defend you against, let’s not get tangled up in semantics! The figure is there to give a ‘fair’ representation of what the ‘average punter’ will stand to gain or lose through the service. This figure does the job if it is accurate but is it the complete picture?

The statistic is actually based on a small set of regulated brokerages (34 in a market of hundreds) and therefore, could contain some margin of error. But let’s keep an open mind to the idea that this might not be the least-flattering assessment of consumer performance. With more or fewer companies in the survey, it could have been worse.
<h3>Why Not 50/50?</h3>
Now, a lay-person to CFD trading could quite rightly ask, why are these gain/loss stats not 50/50? Surely the market has an equal chance of going up, or down, so even the most uninformed punters could expect to ‘guess’ the direction of the rate about half of the time?

Could it be that the very structure and experience of trading through the current crop of platforms lowers the chances of success? I would suggest it plays a part – though it might be tricky to prove. Having personally researched numerous competitors and surveyed the onboarding, assessment, skilling-up and execution of their platforms, there is a lot left to be desired in user-experience terms. Especially when fostering the kind of clear transparent environment needed in the practice of responsible and accurate trading.
<blockquote>The ongoing light-show of scrolling tickers makes it difficult to extract information from the digital bumf on display</blockquote>
Obstructively noisy interfaces with endlessly-flashing buttons, crowded with a myriad of stats and optional functions are the norm. Strikingly few platforms have any obvious user guides for the uninitiated.

The ongoing light-show and scrolling tickers of information make it difficult to extract the important information from the digital bumf on display. The experience itself is by-and-large ‘hard-core’ and assumes a high level of user competence. Granted, only people who have ‘self-certified’ themselves as having trader knowledge are ‘allowed’ to open a trading account in the UK – but the majority of these platforms are far from user-friendly. Improving this shouldn’t be a tricky task for the tech-savvy and cash-rich businesses producing these platforms.
<h3>Accessibility &amp; Closed Circles</h3>
There’s a broader discussion here regarding the average person’s ‘financial literacy’. When it comes to whether investors in CFDs have the appropriate understanding or support network to help avoid common trading errors is, in my opinion, questionable.

A culture of keeping investments in high-risk markets, private is a customer’s choice but it could be harmful when things aren’t going well. We all understand the mistakes sound-minded individuals can make when under pressure or feeling the strain of a bad run of fortune.
<blockquote>We have the tools in this connected age to learn directly from and return patronage to leaders, role-models and influencers</blockquote>
Knowing when to take a pause and re-prioritise matters and not ‘double-down’ in life and finance, is a skill many of us occasionally need support with. A more open culture of sharing, learning and support must be adopted. We have the tools in this connected age to learn directly from and return patronage to leaders, role-models and influencers across all industries.

Trading must modernise towards a more progressive culture and move away from the ‘winners only’ mentality. There’s always as much if not more to learn from your failures in life, than your successes.

<a href=""https://www.getpipster.com/leaderboard/""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1708"" src=""https://www.getpipster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BullRunnersTradesvLossFinal.jpg"" alt="""" width=""2010"" height=""310"" /></a>
<h3>Raising the Standard</h3>
At this stage, we must admit we simply don’t have all the answers right now. However, the concept behind Pipster has always been to improve the ‘standard’ offering and provide a more transparent, concise and relatable experience.

How this will actually feed into the success our users have is something we’ll be monitoring extremely closely. In fact, as well as developing trading software, Finatext is rooted in providing big-data solutions for financial markets. So crunching the numbers and finding out where there are trends in users’ successes and failings will be intrinsic to our future development.

It is not only in the industry’s interest to improve the success rates and experiences of users, but an obligation to strive for better results. Success breeds success and there’s no good reason to simply accept these figures as ‘the way it is’. Pipster has nothing to lose by helping push the statistic in the right direction.

We’ve had a good start, our student Bull Run competition runners had a <strong>loss rate of 32%</strong> – admittedly these were students who were largely studying or interested in finance and trading. When we start our Pioneer Mode this month will be the true test of our mettle.
